## Overview

The **Roblox_Studio MCP server** is **built-in natively** to Roblox Studio as of
mid-2026 and is now the standard integration path. It exposes Studio functionality through the Model Context Protocol,
letting AI agents read, write, and test game code without the developer manually
copy-pasting between the agent and Studio.

> **Migration note:** The previous external Rust binary (`studio-rust-mcp-server`
> on GitHub) has been **archived**. You no longer need to install or run a
> separate process. All MCP functionality is now handled by the native server
> inside Studio.

**Setup:**

1. Open the **Assistant** widget in Roblox Studio.
2. Navigate to **"Manage MCP Servers"**.
3. Enable the **built-in MCP server**.

Tool names and functionality are **unchanged** from the external-server era —
existing agent code and workflows continue to work without modification.

**Key concepts:**

- Tools are **lazily loaded** — read the schema from
  `/Users/sayib/.gemini/antigravity/mcp/Roblox_Studio/<toolName>.json` before
  first use.
- Call tools via `call_mcp_tool` with server name `Roblox_Studio`.
- Studio must be open and the built-in MCP server enabled for calls to succeed.
- If multiple Studio windows are open, use `list_roblox_studios` /
  `set_active_studio` to target the correct one.
- **ScriptDebuggerService (beta):** Provides programmatic access to Studio's
  script debugger — set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables
  via MCP. Currently in beta; use `game:GetService("ScriptDebuggerService")` to
  access. Expect API changes before full release.
- **Studio Assistant Planning Mode:** Enables the Studio Assistant to generate
  and execute multi-step test plans automatically. Agents can leverage this for
  automated testing by triggering Planning Mode workflows through the Assistant
  widget. Useful for verifying complex game flows without manual playtesting.

## Tool Reference

### Reading & Inspecting

| Tool | Purpose | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| `search_game_tree` | Search the Explorer / DataModel hierarchy by name or class | Understanding project structure, finding instances |
| `script_search` | Find scripts by name | Locating a script before reading it |
| `script_grep` | Search inside script source code for a pattern | Finding usages of a function, detecting legacy patterns |
| `script_read` | Read the full source of a script | Understanding existing code before modifying it |
| `inspect_instance` | Get all properties of an Instance | Debugging property values, checking configuration |
| `get_studio_state` | Get current Studio state (Editing, Playing, etc.) | Deciding whether to start/stop a playtest |
| `get_console_output` | Read the Output window | Checking for errors after a change or during playtest |

### Writing & Editing

| Tool | Purpose | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| `execute_luau` | Run arbitrary Luau in the Studio command bar context | Testing snippets, querying game state, creating/modifying instances |
| `multi_edit` | Edit multiple scripts in a single call | Refactoring, renaming across files, batch updates |

**`execute_luau` notes:**

- Runs in the **Plugin** security context (server-side, edit mode).
- During a playtest (`start_stop_play`), code runs in the live DataModel.
- Use `print()` to return diagnostic values — output appears in `get_console_output`.
- Avoid infinite loops; there is no automatic timeout.

**`multi_edit` notes:**

- Accepts a list of `{ scriptPath, newSource }` entries.
- Always `script_read` first to understand current content before overwriting.
- Targets scripts by their full DataModel path
  (e.g., `ServerScriptService.GameManager`).

### Asset Management

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `search_asset` | Search the Roblox marketplace / Toolbox for models, decals, audio, etc. |
| `insert_asset` | Insert a marketplace asset into the DataModel by asset ID |
| `upload_image` | Upload a local image file to Roblox (returns an asset ID) |

### AI Content Generation

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `generate_mesh` | Generate a 3D mesh from a text prompt |
| `generate_procedural_model` | Generate a procedural model (trees, rocks, etc.) |
| `generate_material` | Generate a PBR material from a text prompt |

These tools return asynchronous jobs. Use `wait_job_finished` to poll completion.

### Playtesting & Input Simulation

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `start_stop_play` | Start or stop a playtest session |
| `character_navigation` | Move the player character to a world position during playtest |
| `user_mouse_input` | Simulate mouse clicks / movement |
| `user_keyboard_input` | Simulate key presses |
| `screen_capture` | Capture a screenshot of the current viewport |
| `store_image` | Persist a captured image for later reference |

### Multi-Instance Management

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `list_roblox_studios` | List all open Roblox Studio windows |
| `set_active_studio` | Switch the active Studio instance for subsequent calls |

## Recommended Workflows

### 1. Read-Before-Write

Always understand the existing code and structure before making changes.

```text
1. search_game_tree  →  find relevant services / folders
2. script_search     →  locate the target script(s)
3. script_read       →  read current source
4. multi_edit        →  apply changes with full context
```

**Why:** Blind overwrites break references to other scripts, miss existing
patterns the project relies on, and create merge conflicts.

### 2. Test-After-Change

Verify every change by running the game.

```text
1. multi_edit            →  apply code changes
2. get_console_output    →  check for immediate syntax/load errors
3. start_stop_play       →  begin playtest
4. get_console_output    →  check runtime errors / print output
5. screen_capture        →  visually verify (optional)
6. start_stop_play       →  stop playtest
```

### 3. Debug Loop

When a runtime error is reported or behavior is wrong:

```text
1. get_console_output        →  read the error message and stack trace
2. script_read               →  read the offending script
3. execute_luau              →  query live state (inspect variables, instances)
4. multi_edit                →  fix the issue
5. start_stop_play           →  restart playtest
6. get_console_output        →  confirm the fix
```

### 4. Legacy Pattern Detection

Use `script_grep` to scan for deprecated APIs before migrating:

```text
1. script_grep("spawn(")         →  find legacy spawn calls
2. script_grep("wait(")          →  find legacy wait calls
3. script_grep("delay(")         →  find legacy delay calls
4. script_read  (each result)    →  review context
5. multi_edit                    →  batch-replace with task.* equivalents
6. start_stop_play               →  verify nothing broke
```

## Best Practices

### General

- **One logical change per `multi_edit` call.** Smaller edits are easier to
  verify and roll back.
- **Always read before writing.** Use `script_read` so you can produce a
  correct, complete replacement — not a guess.
- **Check `get_studio_state` before playtesting.** If Studio is already playing,
  stop first or your `start_stop_play` call may toggle incorrectly.

### Performance

- **Batch related edits** into a single `multi_edit` call instead of making
  many sequential calls — each MCP round-trip has latency.
- **Avoid large `execute_luau` loops** that create thousands of Instances at
  once; Studio may freeze. Batch creation with `task.wait()` yields.

### Safety

- **Never delete services** (`Workspace`, `ReplicatedStorage`, etc.) via
  `execute_luau`. Destroying core services crashes Studio.
- **Don't overwrite scripts you haven't read.** You may destroy code the
  developer has been working on outside the agent session.
- **Treat `execute_luau` as a command bar** — it has full plugin-level access.
  Avoid destructive operations like `game:ClearAllChildren()`.

### Debugging

- **Print liberally** in `execute_luau` — it is the primary way to get values
  back from Studio since MCP tools do not return Luau values directly.
- **Check `get_console_output` after every change**, even if there is no
  visible error — warnings and deprecation notices are easy to miss.
- **Use `inspect_instance`** to verify property values rather than guessing.
  Common gotcha: a Part's `Anchored` property defaulting to `false`.
