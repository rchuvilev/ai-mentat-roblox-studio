# Building 3D in Roblox: Full Reference


> **Code in this reference is illustrative. Adapt to your game and verify in Studio before production use.**

Use this skill when creating physical geometry in Roblox Studio (via MCP or standalone scripts). Covers single objects, room-scale structures, and multi-zone maps.

## MCP Mode (if using MCP bridge)

MCP code execution is stateless. Every call is a blank slate.

1. **Variables don't persist** between calls.
2. **Object references are lost** between calls.
3. **Fix**: Re-acquire references at the start of EVERY call.

```luau
-- MUST be at the start of every MCP call
local model = workspace:FindFirstChild("MyBuild")
if not model then
    model = Instance.new("Model")
    model.Name = "MyBuild"
    model.Parent = workspace
end
```

**Ground Truth Rule**: Never guess coordinates from chat history. If you need the position/size of a previously created part, READ it from workspace first:

```luau
local existing = model:FindFirstChild("TableTop")
if existing then
    print(existing.CFrame, existing.Size) -- read before calculating offsets
end
```

## MCP Build Contract

Use the shared `roblox-studio-mcp` session contract. Before changing a place:

1. List/select the intended Studio and call `get_studio_state`.
2. Confirm the target datamodel and inspect `Workspace`, existing map roots, coordinate conventions, scripts, and reusable assets.
3. Declare a build root, origin, named dimensions, asset manifest, and acceptance gates.
4. Apply one bounded phase at a time. Re-acquire references in every stateless `execute_luau` call.
5. Read back the tree and properties before starting the next phase.
6. Start play only when runtime behavior matters. Capture console, navigation, and visual evidence, then stop play.

If a capability is unavailable, switch to the offline Luau path and identify the missing evidence instead of claiming the build was verified.

## Asset-Aware Prop Workflow

Choose the least risky source that satisfies the prop:

1. **Reuse:** inspect and search existing project/Creator Store assets. Record ID, source, type, price/provenance, and intended parent. For cross-owner or paid results, get explicit consent before insertion.
2. **Procedural:** use `generate_procedural_model` for configurable primitive-part props, buildings, scenery, and image-guided blockouts. Pass meaningful `partNames` and user requirements as the prompt. The tool may auto-insert the result.
3. **Mesh:** use `generate_mesh` for a custom textured prop. Bound the size and triangle budget; do not treat the returned mesh as accepted until inspected.
4. **Material:** use `generate_material`, then apply and verify its returned base material and material-variant name on target parts.
5. **Image:** use `store_image` for permitted local PNG/JPG references or `upload_image` for a permitted source accepted by the live schema. Never upload external content without permission.
6. **Wait:** if a generation returns a job ID, call `wait_job_finished` with its `generationId` before dependent edits. Follow the live tool schema because some generation tools complete or insert automatically.
7. **Place:** parent the result under the named build root, set pivot/transform, and read back class, descendants, bounds, materials, collision, anchoring, and asset provenance.
8. **Fallback:** use native Parts, CSG, primitives, and coherent materials when generation is unavailable, slow, rejected, or visually unsuitable.

Generated assets are candidates. Structural and visual review are still required.

## Mesh-Backed Geometry

`MeshPart` is a `BasePart` with a custom mesh. Treat the visible mesh, its appearance, and its collision shape as separate review surfaces:

- read back `MeshId`/`MeshContent`, `MeshSize`, transform, bounds, `Anchored`, `CanCollide`, `CanTouch`, `CanQuery`, and `CollisionFidelity`;
- inspect a child `SurfaceAppearance` and its `ColorMap`, normal, metalness, roughness, and emissive maps when present; PBR appearance depends on device and graphics quality, so preview representative quality levels;
- do not imply that a runtime script can repair `MeshId` or most PBR maps. Resolve authoring/import issues before placement, then verify after insertion;
- record source and intended use for each non-original mesh. A repeated asset key may indicate reuse, but static equality is not proof of license or quality.

Use native Parts or CSG for simple collision and blockout geometry. Use a separate low-cost collision model when the visible mesh is large, detailed, or non-interactive. Let measured playtests and profiling, not class counts, decide performance changes.

## Player Scale Reference

- Player height: ~5 studs
- Doorway: 4 wide × 7 tall
- Ceiling height: 10-14 studs (rooms), 16+ (halls)
- Table/counter top: 3.5-4 studs from floor
- Seat height: ~1.5 studs from floor
- Paths: minimum 6 studs wide (10+ for main roads)
- Stair step: 1 stud rise, 1.5 stud run

## Build Process

### Objects (single Model)

1. **Assess**: Do you know the components, scale, and style? If not, ask.
2. **Plan**: Declare dimensions as named variables. Choose an anchor part.
3. **Build**: Generate parts with relative positioning. Split across calls if >20 parts.
4. **Verify**: Run validation (check Anchored, below-floor, default colors).

### Maps (multi-zone)

1. **Layout**: Define total size, zone breakdown, gameplay type. If any is vague, ask.
2. **Ground**: Floor planes, boundaries, Origin anchor, folder hierarchy.
3. **Zone shells**: Floor sections, walls, dividers per zone.
4. **Landmarks**: Orientation structures (towers, fountains, trees).
5. **Fill**: Props, furniture, vegetation per zone.
6. **Environment**: Lighting, Atmosphere, SpawnLocations.

## Spatial Patterns

### Geometric Manifest (named dimensions, no magic numbers)

```luau
local Def = {
    Width = 6.0,
    Depth = 3.0,
    Height = 2.8,
    TopThickness = 0.2,
    LegSize = 0.3,
    LegInset = 0.1,
}
```

### Relative Positioning (anchor pattern)

All sub-parts position relative to an anchor part's CFrame. Never use hardcoded world coordinates.

```luau
local top = Instance.new("Part")
top.Size = Vector3.new(Def.Width, Def.TopThickness, Def.Depth)
top.CFrame = CFrame.new(0, Def.Height - Def.TopThickness / 2, 0)
top.Anchored = true
top.Parent = model

-- Legs relative to top
local legH = Def.Height - Def.TopThickness
local leg = Instance.new("Part")
leg.Size = Vector3.new(Def.LegSize, legH, Def.LegSize)
local ox = Def.Width / 2 - Def.LegSize / 2 - Def.LegInset
local oz = Def.Depth / 2 - Def.LegSize / 2 - Def.LegInset
leg.CFrame = top.CFrame * CFrame.new(ox, -(Def.TopThickness / 2 + legH / 2), oz)
leg.Anchored = true
leg.Parent = model
```

### Grid Snapping

Snap dimensions to consistent increments (0.125, 0.25, or 0.5 studs). Avoid arbitrary decimals like 0.333 or 1.17 which compound into visible gaps.

## CSG (Union / Subtract)

### The Epsilon Rule

Cutters MUST slightly overlap boundaries they cut through. Coplanar surfaces cause Z-fighting or leave microscopic skins.

```luau
local EPSILON = 0.05

-- Hole through a 1-stud thick wall
local wall = Instance.new("Part")
wall.Size = Vector3.new(10, 10, 1)

local cutter = Instance.new("Part")
-- Add EPSILON*2 to the axis passing through the wall
cutter.Size = Vector3.new(2, 2, 1 + EPSILON * 2)
cutter.CFrame = wall.CFrame
```

### Safe CSG Wrapper

CSG operations are async and can fail. Always pcall, verify, and clean up.

```luau
local success, result = pcall(function()
    return basePart:SubtractAsync({cutterPart})
end)

if success and result and result:IsA("BasePart") then
    result.CFrame = basePart.CFrame -- preserve exact transform
    result.UsePartColor = true
    result.Color = basePart.Color
    result.Material = basePart.Material
    result.Name = basePart.Name
    result.Anchored = true
    result.Parent = basePart.Parent

    basePart:Destroy()
    cutterPart:Destroy()
else
    warn("CSG failed:", result)
    cutterPart:Destroy()
end
```

### CSG Rules

- Keep CSG trees shallow. Don't subtract from a part that was already unioned multiple times.
- Perform complex CSG near origin (0,0,0), then PivotTo() the final model to its destination. Floating-point precision degrades far from origin.
- GeometryService supports Part, PartOperation, and MeshPart. Terrain is NOT supported.
- Set `CollisionFidelity = Enum.CollisionFidelity.Box` on decorative unions for performance.

## Terrain Import Workflow

Roblox's built-in terrain sculpting is fine for small worlds but tedious for large open-world landscapes (tutorial guide: Large-Scale Roblox Terrain). The proven external pipeline: generate a landscape in a desktop terrain tool, import as an OBJ mesh, then convert to voxel terrain so it streams with the engine.

1. Generate: Quadspinner Gaea (free tier, 1k map resolution) with a Primitive → Displace → Erosion node graph. Add a Mesher node at the end, export as `.tor` then OBJ.
2. Optimize (optional): import OBJ into Blender, apply a Decimate modifier down to ~50-200k faces if the mesh is too heavy to import (note: too few triangles = holes after voxel conversion).
3. Import into Studio: use the OBJ Importer plugin (converts vertex data to wedges/parts) in a blank place; this bypasses Roblox's OBJ polygon limit.
4. Convert to terrain: run a part-to-voxel conversion script over the imported parts. Heightmap import is faster and supports higher resolutions, but the selective material-painting step below only works on the mesh path.

**Material painting:** with the mesh path you can paint materials automatically by slope and altitude (e.g. rock on steep slopes, grass on flats), then the voxel conversion preserves the painted result. For imported heightmaps, paint via a color map that adheres to Roblox's colormap material set instead.

Gaea is resource-hungry (8-16 GB RAM recommended; Studio uses a lot during import). Lower-end hardware can still manage the 1k free-tier resolution.

> Heightmaps cannot represent overhangs or caves; use the mesh path for those.

## Platform Quirks

### Cylinder Orientation

Cylinders extend along the **X-axis** by default. To stand one upright:

```luau
local pillar = Instance.new("Part")
pillar.Shape = Enum.PartType.Cylinder
pillar.Size = Vector3.new(10, 2, 2) -- Length, Diameter, Diameter
pillar.CFrame = CFrame.new(0, 5, 0) * CFrame.Angles(0, 0, math.pi / 2)
```

### WedgePart Orientation

The zero-height edge (tip) points toward +Z by default.

| Desired tip direction | Rotation |
|---|---|
| Up (+Y) | `CFrame.Angles(-math.pi/2, 0, 0)` |
| Down (-Y) | `CFrame.Angles(math.pi/2, 0, 0)` |
| Forward (+Z) | none |
| Backward (-Z) | `CFrame.Angles(math.pi, 0, 0)` |

### Neon Material

Neon glows visually but does NOT cast light on surroundings. Add a PointLight/SpotLight as a child for actual illumination.

### Default Part Properties

Always set explicitly:
- `Anchored = true` (defaults to false!)
- `CanCollide = true` (false for small decorative clutter)
- `CastShadow = true` (false for invisible triggers)

## Anti-Patterns

- **Guessing coordinates**: Read from workspace, don't rely on chat memory.
- **Unanchored parts**: They fall. Always set Anchored = true.
- **Hardcoded world positions**: Use relative offsets from anchor CFrame.
- **Block-only for organic shapes**: Use CSG, Cylinders, Spheres, WedgeParts.
- **Silent CSG failures**: Always pcall and verify result is BasePart.
- **Building everything in one call**: Split by phase. 20-30 parts per call max.
- **Floating geometry**: All structures must connect to ground or parent structure.
- **Default colors**: Always set explicit Color and Material. Default gray = unfinished.

## Validation Script

Run after building to catch common issues:

```luau
local TARGET = "MyBuild" -- change to your model/folder name
local root = workspace:FindFirstChild(TARGET)
if not root then print("[ERROR] " .. TARGET .. " not found"); return end

local errors, warnings, parts = 0, 0, 0
for _, desc in ipairs(root:GetDescendants()) do
    if desc:IsA("BasePart") then
        parts += 1
        if not desc.Anchored then
            print("[ERROR] " .. desc:GetFullName() .. " not Anchored")
            errors += 1
        end
        if desc.Position.Y - desc.Size.Y / 2 < -0.5 then
            print("[WARN] " .. desc.Name .. " below floor")
            warnings += 1
        end
        if desc.Color == Color3.new(163/255, 162/255, 165/255) and desc.Material == Enum.Material.Plastic then
            print("[WARN] " .. desc.Name .. " uses default color/material")
            warnings += 1
        end

        -- For MeshPart, read back MeshId/MeshContent. If the asset manifest
        -- expects PBR, inspect child SurfaceAppearance maps in Studio or
        -- plugin tooling; ordinary runtime scripts may not access most maps.
    end
end
print(string.format("Parts: %d | Errors: %d | Warnings: %d", parts, errors, warnings))
```

If any errors: fix and re-verify. Warnings are advisory.

## Map Folder Structure

```
workspace/
  MapName/                  (Folder)
    Origin                  (invisible anchor at 0,0,0)
    Terrain/                (ground planes)
    Zone_Spawn/
      Floor
      Walls/
      Props/
    Zone_Arena/
    Landmarks/
    Lighting/               (PointLights, SpotLights)
    Spawns/                 (SpawnLocation instances)
```

## Acceptance Gates

Before calling a prop complete, verify:

- exactly one named model under the intended build root
- pivot and bounding box are sensible at player scale
- every structural part has deliberate anchoring, collision, material, and color
- no loose or duplicate parts remain
- generated or inserted assets have recorded provenance and were read back after placement

Before calling a map phase complete, verify:

- the map root and `Origin` are present
- zone floors and landmarks are inside the intended bounds
- each named spawn has a navigable return path, is not inside collision or facing a wall, and, when the design declares a fixed session population, spawn count matches it
- main paths are reachable and wide enough
- geometry is connected to the ground or a parent structure
- bounds calculations exclude `Baseplate`, `Terrain`, and default `SpawnLocation` unless intentionally included

## Player-Facing Route Acceptance

Treat a map as a player path, not only a geometry tree:

1. Draw the main route as nodes and edges: spawn, first action, decision points, checkpoints, goals, returns, and exits.
2. From every spawn, verify that the next landmark or affordance is visible, the camera is not inside geometry, and the player is not facing a wall or hazard.
3. Give each critical action a readable world cue and feedback. Route prompts and input to their owning skills rather than encoding progress in decoration alone.
4. Check the return path and recovery from falls, death, wrong turns, and interrupted traversal.
5. Playtest from the player camera at representative movement speeds. A top-down editor view cannot prove wayfinding or spatial onboarding.

Use runtime observation or a small funnel to judge onboarding success. Static route structure can reveal what to test, not whether players understand it.

For world interactions, prefer `ProximityPrompt` when cross-device button or hold semantics fit. Use `ClickDetector` for simple click interactions and `Touched` only when physical contact is the mechanic. `BillboardGui`, `SurfaceGui`, and `Highlight` provide cues, not authority. Validate outcomes on the server from current distance, state, cooldown, and ownership.

## Large-Place Readback

For a large root, do not use an unbounded "dump everything" readback as the only check. Partition the inspection by build root or zone and collect:

- instance and descendant counts, plus bounds and pivot for each scope;
- class counts for structural and effect-heavy classes such as `MeshPart`, `UnionOperation`, `SurfaceAppearance`, `Attachment`, and `ParticleEmitter`;
- anchoring, collision, and query-state exceptions;
- repeated mesh, texture, and image references that may deserve deduplication review;
- the smallest representative set of paths needed to investigate each exception.

Use the report to choose the next bounded inspection or playtest. Static counts are triage signals, not proof of quality, usability, memory use, or frame rate. Confirm performance concerns with Scene Analysis, the Developer Console, MicroProfiler, and representative devices.

## Evidence Recipes

- **Structural:** return counts, classes, paths, bounds, pivots, materials, anchoring errors, collision errors, and asset IDs from an edit-time inspection.
- **Visual:** use `screen_capture` with a deliberate camera position when supported. If capture fails or hangs, report that and retain structural evidence rather than inventing visual conclusions.
- **Runtime:** start play, navigate to the spawn and a representative landmark, exercise the relevant interaction, collect console output, and stop play. A clean console is evidence of no observed errors, not proof of all behavior.
- **Recovery:** if a phase fails, preserve the last verified phase, remove only the disposable failed output, and retry with a smaller batch or native fallback.
