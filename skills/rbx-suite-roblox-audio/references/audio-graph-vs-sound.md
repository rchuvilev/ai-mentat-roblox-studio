# Audio Graph vs Legacy Sound

**Official sources:**
- https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/audio/objects (graph)
- https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/reference/engine/classes/Sound (legacy)
- https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/reference/engine/classes/SoundService

The official docs now state that `Sound`, `SoundGroup`, and `SoundEffect` are **discouraged in favor of the more robust functionality of audio objects**. New work should use the graph; legacy `Sound` code that works can stay.

## Capability comparison

| Capability | Legacy `Sound` | Audio graph |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2D (global) audio | `Sound` not parented to a part | `AudioPlayer` → `Wire` → `AudioDeviceOutput` |
| 3D positional audio | `Sound` parented to `BasePart`/`Attachment` | `AudioPlayer` → `Wire` → `AudioEmitter` (parented to part) |
| Distance attenuation | `RollOffMode`, `RollOffMaxDistance`, `RollOffMinDistance`, `EmitterSize` | `AudioEmitter.DistanceAttenuation` (`NumberSequence` when `DistanceAttenuationMode == Custom`) or preset `DistanceAttenuationMode` + `DistanceAttenuationBounds` (`[4,10000]`) |
| Doppler | Automatic (affected by `SoundService.DopplerScale`, `DistanceFactor`) | Automatic for `AudioEmitter`/`AudioListener` (affected by `SoundService.AcousticSimulationEnabled`) |
| Group volume / mixing | `SoundGroup` | `AudioFader` (one fader controls many streams) |
| Per-source effects | `SoundEffect` subclasses on `SoundGroup` | `AudioEqualizer` etc. in the signal path |
| Global reverb | `SoundService.AmbientReverb` (preset enum) | `AudioReverb` instance; or `SoundService.AcousticSimulationEnabled` for automatic |
| Text-to-speech | Not available | `AudioTextToSpeech` |
| Speech-to-text | Not available | `AudioSpeechToText` |
| Microphone capture | Not directly | `AudioDeviceInput` |
| Acoustic occlusion/diffraction | Not available | `AudioEmitter`/`AudioListener` `AcousticSimulationEnabled` + per-instance `OcclusionEnabled`/`DiffractionEnabled`/`ReverbEnabled` (`SimulationMode`) |
| Routing multiple sources through one effect | Hard (per-group effects only) | Native (many wires → one effect → one output) |
| Tweenable parameter | `Sound.Volume` (number) | `AudioPlayer.TimeVolume` and other number props |

## Text-to-speech voice IDs

`AudioTextToSpeech` accepts the English voices 1–11 and locale-specific pairs: Spanish 101–102, German 201–202, Italian 301–302, French 401–402, Chinese 501–502, Hindi 601–602, Japanese 701–702, Arabic 801–802, Korean 901–902, and Portuguese 1001–1002. The odd ID is male and the even ID is female in every locale-specific pair.

## When to keep using `Sound`

- Simple 2D SFX or music with no routing, no effects, no TTS/STT.
- Existing working code — don't rewrite just to migrate.
- Quick prototypes and one-shot UI clicks.
- When you need `SoundService.AmbientReverb`'s preset behavior (it doesn't apply to the graph).

## When to use the graph

- 3D audio with custom attenuation curves.
- Multiple sources through a shared effect (all gunfire → one compressor).
- Text-to-speech or speech-to-text.
- Acoustic simulation (occlusion through walls, diffraction around corners).
- Any new, non-trivial audio system where routing and mixing matter.
- Voice-driven features (capture via `AudioDeviceInput`, STT via `AudioSpeechToText`).

## Migration notes

The graph and legacy systems can coexist in one experience. `SoundService` properties split: `AmbientReverb`, `DopplerScale`, `DistanceFactor`, `RespectFilteringEnabled` affect **only legacy `Sound`**; `AcousticSimulationEnabled` affects **only the graph**. `ListenerLocation` and `DefaultListenerLocation` affect the graph's `AudioListener`.

There is no automatic migration. To migrate:
1. Replace each `Sound` parented to a part with `AudioPlayer` + `Wire` + `AudioEmitter` on the same part.
2. Replace `SoundGroup` volume control with an `AudioFader` that all relevant players wire through.
3. Replace `EqualizerSoundEffect` etc. with the corresponding `Audio*` effect in the signal path.
4. For global reverb, either add an `AudioReverb` to the bus or enable `SoundService.AcousticSimulationEnabled`.
5. Re-tune attenuation: `RollOffMode`/`RollOffMaxDistance` don't map 1:1 to `DistanceAttenuation` (a curve) — redesign the curve by ear.

## Legacy `Sound` quick reference (still useful)

| Property | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SoundId` | `rbxassetid://...` |
| `Volume` | 0–4 (amplitude; >1 can clip) |
| `Looped` | boolean |
| `PlaybackSpeed` | 1 = normal; pitch and speed together |
| `EmitterSize` | Larger = louder at distance before rolloff begins |
| `RollOffMode` | Inverse, InverseTangent, Linear, LinearSquare, Cubic, CubicTangent |
| `RollOffMinDistance` / `RollOffMaxDistance` | Rolloff range |
| `IsPlaying`, `IsPaused`, `TimePosition` | Runtime state |
| `:Play()`, `:Pause()`, `:Stop()`, `:Resume()` | Control |
| `Loaded` event, `IsLoaded` | Asset readiness |
| `DidLoop` event | Loop counter (for finite loops) |

`SoundGroup.Volume` scales all member `Sound`s; `SoundGroup` can hold `SoundEffect` children.
