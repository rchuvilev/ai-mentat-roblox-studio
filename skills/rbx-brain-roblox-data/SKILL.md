# roblox data persistence

## When to Load

Load when designing player saves, schema migrations, retries, shutdown handling, or session ownership. Use `roblox-server-data` for ordered leaderboards, messaging, and global world data; `roblox-cloud` for Open Cloud and external API access.

## Quick Reference

- Define a serializable template and a version field before storing player state.
- Use `UpdateAsync` for read-modify-write operations and handle throttling or transient errors.
- Prevent two servers from mutating the same player's profile at once, either with a well-understood wrapper or an equivalent session protocol.
- If using ProfileStore, use `StartSessionAsync`, `Profile.OnSessionEnd`, and `EndSession` as documented. Do not use its `Steal` option for normal player loading.
- Use `ProfileStore.Mock` for Studio tests that must not write live DataStore keys.
- Save on meaningful changes and on lifecycle boundaries, but do not assume `PlayerRemoving` alone is sufficient.
- Use `BindToClose` to finish pending work within Roblox's shutdown window.
- Store primitives, arrays, and dictionaries. Convert Instances, userdata, functions, and cyclic tables first. Before persisting client-influenced values: numbers must not be NaN or infinity, strings must pass `utf8.len`, and any nested table must be re-validated, since one unsaveable value fails the whole key write.
