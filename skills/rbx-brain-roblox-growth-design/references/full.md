# Roblox Growth Design: Full Reference

> Examples, thresholds, and practitioner playbooks are starting hypotheses, not universal laws. Verify platform behavior against the dated sources, adapt to the game and audience, and test before broad rollout.

This reference combines Roblox's published discovery and analytics guidance with original practitioner synthesis. Sections labeled **Official** restate current Creator Hub behavior. Sections labeled **Heuristic** are diagnostic lenses, not claims about the recommendation algorithm. §8.3 practitioner heuristics are original synthesis derived from the submitted draft and operator experience; treat them as experience, not official guidance.

## 1. Operating Model

A game-design diagnosis should connect four layers:

1. **Promise:** what audience the title, icon, thumbnails, and premise attract.
2. **First session:** join reliability, comprehension, time-to-fun, and the first core-loop payoff.
3. **Long-term game:** progression, variety, social value, identity, mastery, and LiveOps.
4. **Business:** transparent products that add player value without damaging trust or the economy.

Do not jump from a weak metric to a feature prescription. A metric is an observation. Several causes can produce the same observation, and one change can move several metrics.

### Evidence hierarchy

Use the strongest available evidence:

1. Roblox Experiments with an adequate minimum detectable effect (MDE), full planned duration, confidence intervals, and stable variants.
2. Cohort or release comparisons with acquisition source, platform, locale, player age, and seasonality controlled where practical.
3. Funnels, session traces, errors, performance reports, economy sources/sinks, and behavioral telemetry.
4. Moderated playtests, player observation, support reports, surveys, and community feedback.
5. Competitor teardown and practitioner intuition.

The lower levels generate hypotheses. They do not prove causation.

### Experiment brief

Before changing the game, write:

- **Observation:** what moved, for which cohort and date range?
- **Hypothesis:** if we change Y because evidence Z, metric X should move.
- **Primary metric:** one measure tied to the hypothesis.
- **Guardrails:** metrics that must not regress, such as errors, D1, economy inflation, payer complaints, accessibility, or mobile frame rate.
- **Exposure:** eligible players, control, variant, rollout, and planned duration.
- **Decision rule:** what confidence and practical effect justify shipping?

Roblox Experiments run for 14–60 days. Do not use first-day results for decisions, stop because a favorable line appears, or claim a causal win without statistical significance. Stop or roll back for safety, severe regressions, broken instrumentation, or invalid exposure. Games below roughly 1,000 daily active users may struggle to detect useful effects; use the dashboard's MDE rather than inventing a universal traffic threshold.

**Experiments mechanics (official).** In-game experiments apply per-player config values; matchmaking experiments test matchmaking configs (only one matchmaking experiment at a time; recommend 100% rollout to avoid isolating players). Implementation:

- Use `ConfigService:GetConfigForPlayerAsync(player)` (not `GetConfigAsync`) to get a player-specific snapshot. `GetValue` on that snapshot enrolls the player; the first call is random, every later call returns the same variant for the experiment duration.
- Call `GetValue` as late as possible. Calling it early enrolls players who never reach the feature you are testing.
- Target enrollment with your own criteria: check the condition (e.g. new player), then enroll only those players (e.g. `racesCompleted == 0`). For cross-session persistence, store the assignment.
- Experiments track all metrics (D1, D7, playtime, ARPU, ARPPU, payer conversion, session time) regardless of the goal metric you pick. Use the Results tab after completion; a metric is significant when its confidence interval does not overlap 0%. Use "Make decision" to promote a variant to the default config.

**Experiments best practices (official):**
- Start with a written cause-and-effect hypothesis.
- Use the MDE to decide if the experiment is worth running; if the MDE is too high (e.g. >100%), statistical significance is unlikely.
- Let experiments run their full duration: the novelty effect can skew early results in and out of significance.
- Don't act without significance. If one metric is up and another down, decide whether the trade-off is worth it.
- Avoid unrelated changes during a running experiment; they can invalidate results. Only run simultaneous experiments if confident they won't interact.
- Use confidence intervals for deep dives; a too-wide interval means the metric may never reach significance.
- Balance experiment results against qualitative player feedback and the product vision. Experiments are probabilities, not certainties.
- Document findings and decisions as a body of knowledge.

### Acquire evidence before diagnosis

Ask for the evidence that actually exists: Creator Dashboard screenshots or exports, cohort windows, release dates, acquisition mix, session recordings, and player feedback. Use Studio or project telemetry for runtime facts when available. State what is missing and never fabricate a metric, cohort, or causal explanation.

### Static project structure: hypothesis only

A static `.rbxl` or `.rbxm` can reveal implementation structures, not player success, usability, retention, conversion, or fun. Use a short handoff:

1. **Observe:** name the structure and evidence boundary.
2. **Question:** translate it into a player-facing question.
3. **Instrument:** choose the smallest success and abandonment events that can answer it.
4. **Test:** use observation, logs, cohorts, or an experiment. Keep static evidence and measured outcomes separate.

## 2. Official Home Recommendations Model

<!-- temporal: 2026-07 -->

Roblox's **Recommended for You** system has two stages:

### Retrieval

The system selects a personalized subset of games using signals such as engagement, retention, and monetization. Sponsored ads, search, charts, friends, teleports, notifications, curation, and external sharing can bring initial players and help a game receive consideration for organic discovery.

### Ranking

The system ranks retrieved candidates for each user. How far organic Home distribution expands depends on users acquired through Recommended for You. Engagement, retention, and monetization from users first acquired through ads, search, friends, social media, or another source do not enter this ranking stage.

This distinction matters:

- external acquisition can create a useful seed cohort and revenue;
- external cohort behavior is still valuable product evidence;
- it does not directly repair weak organic Home-ranking signals.

### Current signal groups

Roblox says signal influence changes over time. Treat this as a dated map, not a permanent formula.

**Most important**

- **Play through rate:** users who play after a Recommended for You impression.
- **First-play bounce rate:** users leaving after a short first play, segmented at under 60 seconds and 61–180 seconds. This is negative.
- **Play days per user:** average unique play days across D1, D2–7, and D8–28 windows.
- **Playtime per user:** capped for this signal at 60 minutes per user, per game, per day.

**Important**

- intentional co-play days per user;
- qualified play sessions per user;
- spend days per user;
- Robux spent per user.

These are per-user averages. Smaller games are not automatically disadvantaged by lower total player counts.

### Explore, expand, and context

Roblox explores a game with cohorts and can expand distribution when those cohorts respond well. Impression changes are also affected by:

- game updates and gameplay changes;
- recommendation-system changes;
- weekly, school-year, summer, and holiday seasonality;
- competing games improving faster;
- audience expansion into less perfectly matched cohorts.

A temporary decline in play through rate can accompany an impression increase. Do not treat every movement as a penalty or secretly changed feature weight.

### Dashboard workflow

In Creator Hub, use **Analytics > Acquisition > Home Recommendations** (also surfaced in the Creator Analytics Overview page):

1. Inspect Home recommendation impressions and plays.
2. Check the most important signals first.
3. If those are stable, inspect co-play, qualified sessions, spend days, and Robux spend.
4. Compare against similar-game benchmarks as rough context only. Benchmark games do not affect ranking.
5. Segment other acquisition sources separately.

<!-- temporal: 2026-08 -->

### 2026-08 RFY direction (Roblox CGO announcement)

Roblox's Chief Growth Officer stated the next Recommended-for-You update (targeted late August / early September 2026) will better recognize long-term player value: games players return to over time, and where players find value in purchases. Source: DevForum announcement, 2026-08-06.

Working guidance from the same post:

- If retention is low, fix core gameplay first: first session clarity, a satisfying core loop, reasons to return, and iteration from feedback and analytics. Monetization alone cannot carry a game players do not keep playing.
- If retention is strong, build sustainable monetization: value players can feel, offers integrated into progression rather than interrupting play, fair and transparent pricing, and continued content investment.
- Both retention and monetization drive Home impressions; games strong in only one still receive recommendations, but games strong in both may get broader distribution.
- Four factors move Home impressions: your own gameplay/updates, platform algorithm changes (announced transparently), seasonality (weekly peaks on Saturdays, summer/holiday/school cycles), and competing games improving faster. A drop while your signals are steady can be competitive, not punitive.

Treat the timing as temporal; re-check the announcement thread for launch status before citing the update as live.

### Practitioner algorithm mechanics (supplementary)

A live-game operator's practical model of how the Home algorithm behaves. Experience-based; not official Roblox guidance.

**Traffic is learned from, but ads are cold traffic.** A new game needs initial traffic before it can be ranked; ads or short-form content (TikTok/YouTube clips) provide it. Ad traffic is the cheapest, least-qualified audience ("cold"): low engagement, low spend, low D1. Roblox uses ad traffic mainly for initial data to gauge the game and its audience. Home-algo traffic is the qualified audience: higher D1, D7, playtime, and spend. Do not panic if launch stats look bad on ad-sourced players.

**Ranking is progressive.** First, Roblox ranks your game against the broad genre (all games with similar loops/mechanics, including adjacent genres). Then it ranks you against "experiences with similar players": games your players also play (Analytics > Acquisition > Home Recommendations > benchmark). The second benchmark is the real competition: this is where stats usually take a hit, and where games with better stats steal your players (winner-takes-most).

**Ads money does not buy Home placement.** After initial data collection, ad players' statistics do not feed Home ranking (except some caveats). Running more ads without improving stats does not get you into the Home market; it only buys sponsored placement. The lever is meaningful stat-improving updates: run ads → collect data → find worst stat (D1, D7, playtime) → ship an update that improves it → rerun ads to re-feed data on the improved game. Updates move you up the ranking, not ad spend.

**The 28-day signals window (June 2026).** Roblox's RFY algorithm directly measures longer-term retention across Day 1, Day 2–7, and Day 8–28. The pre-June rolling "7-day window" guidance is stale. Optimize onboarding for D1, early loops for D2–7, and content cadence for D8–28; the skill's official §2 retention windows above match this.

**Beta mode (official feature).** While in Beta mode, your experience is not shown in Home recommendations. Use it to tune metrics with cheap ad traffic before opening to the algorithm, so the first Home exposure has already-optimized stats.

**June 2026 metric change (practitioner reading of official docs).** QPTR was split into **Play-Through Rate** (PTR: % of Home impressions converting to play sessions) and **First-Play Bounce Rate** (negative stat: % of players leaving within 60s; also a 61–180s bucket). D28 is now tracked. Bounce rate is a negative signal, so keep it low; clickbait/mystery-game packages that exploited QPTR are "cooked" because bounce rate now exposes them, and template clones and misleading titles suffer. **Experience detail page CTR** (users who played from detail page / users who viewed it) matters for overall PTR: put your best thumbnails and gameplay description there, not just on the Home tile.

**Game-as-funnel framing (from Roblox PM, via practitioner).** Think of the game as a funnel: Home impression → detail page view → play session → engagement → retention. Optimize the whole funnel, not just the thumbnail. Find and fix the single biggest bottleneck first (impression, detail page, bounce, D1, D7, D28), not everything at once.

**Diagnose with "rows" not totals.** In the Creator dashboard, slice engagement and funnels by device, platform, locale, and source. A game with good overall tutorial metrics can be terrible on console or mobile, and that friction caps growth. Console players play long and often; don't skip console.

**The 500 highly-engaged-player requirement (2026 platform change).** Games published for all-ages audiences are first available only to age-checked 16+ users until they complete Roblox's Kids/Select evaluation. Confirmation comes from Roblox's real-time multimodal moderation of player engagement (account age, play history, platform spend) verifying that players are genuine, not bots. Roblox's own definition of a highly engaged player: meets requirements on account tenure, playtime in your game, and platform spend, where platform spend means a minimum purchase **anywhere on Roblox in the last 60 days** (they do not need to spend in your game) **and** time spent in your game within that same window. The exact criteria "will evolve"; re-check the kids-and-select doc. Practitioner-reported dynamics (not official docs):

- Ads are served 16+ automatically with Roblox-recommended targeting; you do not need to target 16+ players yourself.
- You can hit Home algorithm placement before clearing the 500 threshold.
- The fastest path is ads for initial traffic, then Home impressions accelerate the count (engaged players come from Home faster than from ads).
- Anecdotal spend: roughly $16/day for ~2 weeks (~$180) hit the threshold from ads alone; one dev saw 190 in 2 weeks from 210K ad visits, then 350 more from 90K Home visits in 5 days.
- Not a huge new cost: similar to what launch ads already cost; commissions are an option if you cannot fund ads.
- **100 vs 500 thresholds (official).** The 500 unique plays by highly engaged players within 60 days is the Kids/Select **evaluation** requirement and applies to games published to all ages. Separately, the refundable **publishing fee** (1,000 R$) is refunded when your game maintains **100** highly engaged players for 60 days; the **expedited review fee** (100,000 R$) is refundable after 90 days if you maintain **100** highly engaged players. Different thresholds, different purposes. Do not conflate them.
- Fast track (official, shipped): the **expedited review fee** (100,000 R$/game, 48-hour review) lets timed launches reach kids/Select before the 500 bar; refundable after 90 days with 100 highly engaged players. See publish-games-and-places doc.

## 3. Diagnose Metrics Without Single-Cause Thinking

### Low play through rate or thumbnail QPTR

Likely hypotheses:

- icon or thumbnail is unreadable at actual mobile size;
- the image does not communicate genre, action, fantasy, or tone;
- packaging attracts an audience the game cannot satisfy;
- the premise is too familiar without a clear distinction;
- a recent impression expansion reached a broader cohort.

Evidence to collect:

- Home Recommendation play through rate;
- thumbnail personalization QPTR by thumbnail and winning segment;
- qualified plays and average playtime per active thumbnail;
- mobile and desktop previews;
- mismatch between packaging promise and observed first session.

Do not use generic clickbait. A higher click rate paired with worse bounce or retention is not a win.

### High first-play bounce or weak early session survival

Investigate in this order:

1. join failures, crashes, errors, device memory, frame rate, and long loading;
2. metadata-to-game promise mismatch;
3. unclear controls or goal;
4. mandatory menus, dialogue, character creation, or tutorial before meaningful action;
5. first payoff arriving too late;
6. dead or confusing social spaces;
7. platform-specific input or UI failure.

Instrument milestones such as join complete, player gains control, first meaningful action, first reward, core loop complete, and session exit. Track negative outcomes too, such as a failed fight or blocked purchase prompt.

### Low D1 retention

Roblox points to three broad areas: core loop, first-time user experience, and performance.

Useful hypotheses:

- the core loop is understandable but not enjoyable;
- players enjoy one cycle but see no reason to return;
- onboarding teaches mechanics without communicating purpose;
- progression is invisible or the first goal feels arbitrary;
- starter resources do not let players sample the fun;
- mobile, localization, accessibility, or reliability failures affect a segment.

A brief tutorial or contextual tooltips can help. "No tutorial" is not a rule. Teach only the essentials, get to meaningful play quickly, deliver a joyful first payoff, and preview future progress.

**Practitioner heuristics:**
- Instrument Funnels on every tutorial step to find the exact drop-off step, then fix that step specifically rather than redesigning the whole flow.
- "Show, don't tell" is a strong default for younger audiences: let players learn by doing (plant a seed and watch it grow) rather than reading a text block. Some control schemes still require text; keep it brief and contextual.
- Give a concrete reason to return tomorrow: a crop that finishes growing, a daily reward that escalates, a friend's base to visit.

### Low D7 or D30 retention

Do not reduce this to adding daily rewards. Investigate:

- short-, medium-, and long-term goals;
- progression speed and difficulty;
- content variety and mastery depth;
- collections, identity, customization, or status;
- healthy co-play, parties, guilds, competition, and cooperation;
- endgame and recurring reasons to return;
- LiveOps cadence and whether updates deepen the core loop;
- economy inflation or old content becoming obsolete.

D7 often exposes progression weakness. D30 often exposes endgame, content cadence, social value, or exhaustion. The boundary is not absolute.

**Practitioner heuristics:**
- A week of distinct content or goals gives D7 something to chase: a new zone, a rank, a collectible set, a limited-time event.
- Social-flex features (rare cosmetics, leaderboard placement, "admin abuse"-style novelty items players show off) give returning players something to signal status with.
- Live events on a regular cadence give lapsed players a reason to re-open the game.

### Low average session time

Check whether players reach the fun, then whether the loop sustains interest:

- time to first meaningful choice;
- action density versus waiting and travel;
- reward feedback and goal clarity;
- loop variety and escalating challenge;
- social interaction where it genuinely fits;
- performance degradation in longer sessions;
- natural stopping points and return hooks.

**Practitioner heuristic:** give every core-loop action immediate feedback. A rock hit plays a sound and adds slight camera shake; a coin collected pops and increments a visible counter. SFX + VFX on small actions makes the loop feel alive. Test whether feedback density actually moves your playtime before assuming it will.

Longer is not always better. Respect natural sessions; do not trap players with friction or punish leaving.

### Low payer conversion

Investigate product value and purchase friction:

- can players find and understand the shop?
- is the product useful, expressive, durable, or fun?
- does the product fit the player's current progression?
- are there transparent options at several price points?
- does onboarding show value before asking for payment?
- does the funnel fail before or after a Roblox purchase prompt?

A lower-cost first-purchase offer is one hypothesis, not a default. Measure downstream retention, refund/support sentiment, and economy impact.

**Practitioner heuristics:**
- A very cheap starter pack (under 50 Robux) removes the "first purchase" barrier; the goal is converting a non-payer into a payer, not maximizing that transaction.
- Cheap repeatable consumable developer products (e.g., 19 Robux to double offline earnings on login) build a purchasing habit without requiring a large commitment.

**Official item taxonomy.** Purchasable items are durable (unlimited uses, e.g. skins) or consumable (limited uses, e.g. boosts), and each is enhancement (improves capability: speed, protection, tools, event access) or expression (personalizes: skins, emotes, pets). Know what is being sold, where, and how, and make the purpose of each item legible to the player: a purchasable item should have visible value (Roblox's example: a flashlight in *Doors* that players immediately understand aids exploration). Describe items accurately and truthfully.

**Official shop design.** The shop is the experience's economy information hub, not just a market. Make it:
- **Integrated**: consistent icon/UI, quick in and out without disrupting play;
- **Contextual**: players need surrounding context to judge an item's value; explain items in relation to gameplay and each other (a "Revives" explanation teaches that reviving is core, limited functionality);
- **Inviting**: a destination to linger and browse; rotating or new stock gives players a reason to revisit.

Season passes are a documented delivery vehicle for cadence content (official creator-docs page: season-pass-design), though in practice few Roblox games run a classic paid-track pass. A good season pass: follows shop best practices, offers **free and premium tiers** (free keeps non-payers earning; premium is a superset rewarding payers), has **attractive rewards** previewed and tied to the core loop, a **manageable timeframe** (reward spacing relative to average session time; short and long missions; clearly communicated XP levels), and clear remaining-time communication.

### Low ARPPU or ARPDAU

Low ARPPU can mean the catalog lacks depth for engaged payers, but it can also reflect audience, regional pricing, product mix, or a healthy low-pressure economy. Consider durable and consumable options, seasonal products, and meaningful catalog variety.

Always inspect ARPDAU and payer concentration. High ARPPU with low ARPDAU can mean revenue depends on a narrow subset. Do not design around "whales" or use coercive scarcity, deceptive odds, pay-to-escape friction, or manipulative loss aversion.

**Practitioner heuristic:** tiered pricing ("small / medium / large fries") gives engaged payers somewhere to go: a basic pack, a pro pack, and an expensive overpowered pack. The expensive tier exists for players who want to spend; the cheap tiers keep the majority comfortable. Test whether your audience actually has a high-end segment before building for one.

### Declining impressions

Do not assume a shadow penalty. Check:

- Home signal changes by their documented priority;
- recent updates and regression dates;
- acquisition-source mix;
- seasonality;
- broader-cohort exploration;
- competing games and changing audience preferences;
- a Creator Dashboard reduced-exposure banner.

## 4. Positioning and Idea Validation

### The purple-ocean lens

**Heuristic:** seek proven demand with a clear twist rather than a pure clone or an idea with no demonstrated audience.

Use it as a research lens:

1. **Demand:** are players already seeking this fantasy, mechanic, or genre?
2. **Supply:** which games serve it, how concentrated is the audience, and what do reviews or communities dislike?
3. **Difference:** can a player explain this version's distinction in one sentence?
4. **Roblox fit:** does it benefit from avatars, co-play, user identity, short sessions, touch controls, or social graph?
5. **Production fit:** can this team deliver the content, moderation, economy, and update cadence?
6. **Evidence:** what cheap prototype or packaging test could falsify the premise?

Treat third-party estimates as directional. Public CCU, favorites, visits, review activity, social views, Steam wishlists, and Google Trends measure different populations and can be gamed or misread.

### Trend lifecycle

**Heuristic:** Roblox trends tend to move through three phases:

1. **First to market:** an original concept captures initial demand with little competition.
2. **Saturation:** clones and templates flood in; the player base disperses; most copies die.
3. **Mutation:** survivors re-package with a new title, custom thumbnail, or altered core loop. Straight copies of the original's title and thumbnail format fail and can trigger metadata penalties (§6).

If you are entering a trend in phase 2 or 3, a straight clone is the worst position. You need a meaningful twist or an underserved sub-audience.

### Off-platform demand signals

**Heuristic:** demand proven elsewhere de-risks a Roblox launch:

- Indie games with hundreds of thousands of Steam wishlists or millions of web-game plays show proven desire for the core concept.
- Gameplay videos pulling millions of views, especially with younger audiences, predict the concept can explode on Roblox.
- Being the first to bring a highly demanded fantasy to Roblox in a polished way is a strong entry point.

Check the Roblox side too: search for the concept's keywords. Is it actually done well? A theme saturated with basic RP/sims (airports, firefighters) can host a different genre entirely (action-checkpoint, extraction shooter). That gap is the opportunity.

### Premise checks

A useful concept should answer:

- What does the player repeatedly do?
- What fantasy or identity does that action serve?
- What changes after each cycle?
- Why is this better with other players?
- What can be shown honestly in one icon and one thumbnail?
- What remains fun without spending?
- What production burden grows with success?

### What makes a game take off (practitioner checklist)

A live-game operator's five things that make a Roblox game likely to go viral and keep players. Experience-based; not official Roblox guidance.

1. **An idea a kid can picture before bed.** The concept should be something a player would imagine falling asleep to: "a hospital run by animals" (Animal Hospital), "toys that live their own life" (Toy Story), "a city run by animals" (Zootopia). If the packaged title + thumbnail makes a player on the Home page unable to resist clicking, idea works. Test a concept by asking what fantasy the player is fulfilling, not just what the mechanic is.
2. **Great onboarding.** Not a tutorial that drags: get players emotionally invested in the *why* of their actions (title-sequence world-building, cutscenes showing a clearly felt threat), introduce one mechanic at a time, use level design to communicate danger/goals without text, and keep UI minimal during onboarding (Sell Lemons: no UI, fast progression, one mechanic at a time).
3. **Socialization as part of the core loop.** Make the game 10x more fun with friends so friends invite friends (the word-of-mouth flywheel: kids show each other at school/bus). Leaderboards add the social flex; cosmetics and visible progress create FOMO ("that kid is zooming past me"). Even simple social elements beat a great solo incremental with zero interaction.
4. **Simple mechanics with tons of depth.** One obvious mechanic (voxel building, boat building, role-play) that yields near-infinite player expression and session variety ("every session is different": build a new plane, new role, new PvP run). The mechanic must stay easy and frictionless on **mobile** first; on-mobile clunk caps growth even when desktop is fine.
5. **Clippable / strong community.** Design for content creators: visualize what a YouTuber/TikToker would clip from your game, and make those moments frequent and obvious. Community-created content (build showcases, unique hiding spots, crazy plays) compounds virality; watch the moments creators actually include and double down on them. A strong community keeps a game at 8–9K CCU for years.

**Study top games, copy functionality not style.** Play successful games in the genre (especially on mobile and console), understand *why* their onboarding/funnel/social choices work, and copy the function, not the aesthetic one-for-one. Diagnose toy friction by running your own game with a fresh account and watching where a new player gets stuck.

### Production playbook for fast shipping (supplementary)

A live-game operator's process for shipping quality fast, from a producer who runs a two-man team. Experience-based; not official Roblox guidance. Distilled from practitioner video on pumping out high-quality Roblox games quickly.

- **Execution is the bottleneck, not ideas.** Ideas are cheap and everywhere; the scarce resource is reliable execution. A big team is not a flex; top studios run lean (4-person or even 2-person) teams.
- **Get the MVP core loop done first.** Scope a minimal viable product (core loop only) so you can playtest whether the game is fun before investing in the full vision. Use AI (e.g., Claude) to prototype with basic parts and free models before hiring any dev.
- **The game design document is the contract.** A GDD (what players do, leveling, economy, progression) doubles as the statement of work for the programmer. Turn it into per-role Trello columns and actionable tasks per system.
- **Sequence the build: art/UI/models first, programmer second.** Programmers are more productive in a populated workspace; delivering builds/models/UI before scripting keeps execution fast.
- **Communicate visually and asynchronously.** Use recorded video (Loom-style), screenshots, and references to existing games rather than long text; most "wrong work" is a communication gap, not a skill gap. Prototype small ideas with AI first to avoid paid-dev round-trips.
- **Hire T-shaped people.** One person who does programming + UI, or building + modeling + animation, beats a bigger brittle team. Same time zone matters for fast iteration.
- **Reputation and vetting beat money.** In the Roblox talent pool (often young), trust decides everything: hire via Twitter/YouTube presence, prefer paid-upon-completion (never pay in full up front; that kills delivery), always sign a contract, make a new contract for new scope, and don't sneak unagreed work into scope mid-project (it breeds resentment and slows the team).

### Core-loop design

Write the loop as:

> **Action → feedback/reward → progression choice → more expressive or demanding action**

Audit:

- Is the repeated action itself enjoyable?
- Is feedback immediate and readable without relying only on sound, color, or motion?
- Does progression create decisions, not only larger numbers?
- Can a new player complete a meaningful cycle quickly?
- Can the primary action be expressed well on touch, gamepad, and keyboard/mouse, or does one platform require a different interaction model?
- Does the loop remain legible on lower-end devices?
- Does co-play improve the experience rather than merely add bodies?

Prototype the uncertain mechanic before building a large content shell. Prioritize from observed player behavior and the cost of being wrong.

**Practitioner heuristic (80/20):** build roughly 80% from proven mechanics, UI, and progression patterns players are already trained on (core loops, upgrade systems, map layouts from top games in the genre), and spend roughly 20% of your differentiation budget on the theme, fantasy, or twist. The ratio is a starting lens, not a law: a genuinely novel mechanic may need more invention, and a reskin may need less. The point is that familiarity lowers the comprehension barrier while novelty supplies the reason to click.

## 5. First-Time User Experience

Design for **play-first teaching**, not "players never read." Some controls and systems require text. Make instruction brief, contextual, localized, and accessible.

Roblox's retention guidance recommends reaching the fun within about five minutes. Treat that as a diagnostic starting point, not permission to rush a complex control scheme.

A first-session sequence can be:

1. safe arrival with the game responsive;
2. one obvious action and immediate feedback;
3. one small choice that expresses agency;
4. first core-loop completion;
5. a joyful payoff;
6. visible next goals;
7. optional deeper explanation after motivation exists.

**Official onboarding mechanics.** The FTUE succeeds on two metrics: D1 retention and onboarding goals (teaching essentials, getting to fun quickly, leaving players wanting more). Practical levers:

- **Player XP-based leveling**: keep early-level XP thresholds low so players level up fast and feel progression immediately. Tune thresholds with Configs in real time without shipping an update.
- **Starter items and currency**: free equipment/soft currency lets players sample utility or expression early. Find the balance with Experiments (gift different starting amounts), then push the winner as a Config.
- **Goals and moments of joy**: surface short/mid/long-term goals in highly visible places (skill trees, season passes, quests, collections); end onboarding with an intentionally designed moment of joy (rewards, delightful animations, celebratory VFX).
- **Funnel instrumentation**: list core-loop steps, track completion rate per step (with special in-game items as step markers), track negative outcomes (lost fights, blocked purchases), and fix the biggest drop-off. Target the funnel with Experiments on specific steps (shorter dialogue vs guided arrow) to get causal answers.
- **Social FTUE**: if the game is social-first, use Experiments on matchmaking parameters during FTUE to find groupings that improve long-term engagement.

Observe representative players rather than relying on teammates who know the game. When testing with minors, use appropriate consent, privacy, safeguarding, and moderated research practices. Do not collect unnecessary personal data.

**Practitioner heuristics for mobile friction:**
- Mobile UX fails by "death by a thousand cuts": each tiny friction point is tolerable alone but they accumulate until the player quits.
- Hand the game to a target-demo player on a phone or tablet, explain nothing, and watch. UX failures, stuck points, and frustrations surface immediately.
- Remove tap tedium: if upgrading takes 500 taps, add "Buy 100" / "Max Buy" buttons on the HUD.
- Keep maps compact and action-dense. Excessive walking between points of interest kills engagement, especially on mobile. Proven compact layouts (floating-island style, hub-and-spoke) get players into the action faster.

### Accessibility and device coverage

At minimum check:

- touch targets and thumb reach;
- gamepad focus and keyboard/mouse controls;
- readable text at supported text sizes;
- sufficient contrast and symbols in addition to color;
- captions or visual cues for sound-only information;
- reduced-motion behavior;
- localization expansion and bidirectional layout where relevant;
- lower-end mobile memory, thermal load, frame rate, and network conditions.

Cross-reference `roblox-input`, `roblox-ui-design`, `roblox-localization`, `roblox-performance`, `roblox-audio`, and `roblox-animation-vfx` for implementation.

## 6. Packaging and Metadata

### Official requirements and behavior

Use accurate, original metadata. Roblox can reduce exposure for:

- giveaway-led metadata;
- mismatched metadata and gameplay;
- non-unique games with metadata and place files closely resembling existing games.

Quality status is reclassified with updates. Reduced-exposure experiences receive a Creator Dashboard banner that updates daily.

Icons should be square and at least 512×512. Thumbnails should be 16:9 and ideally 1920×1080. Preview both at small mobile sizes. Keep essential details away from areas Roblox overlays with metadata.

### Thumbnail personalization

For Home personalization:

1. Activate 2–5 accurate thumbnails.
2. Roblox initially explores them across users, then allocates more impressions to winners by segment while retaining exploration traffic.
3. Inspect impressions, qualified plays, average playtime, QPTR, and winning segment.
4. Keep multiple thumbnails active so personalization can adapt.
5. Test new thumbnails around a major game or content update, then avoid changing them again until the next update.

QPTR here means qualified plays divided by Home recommendation impressions. The broader Discovery signal table separately calls its top conversion signal **play through rate**. Do not silently treat every dashboard's denominator or qualification rules as identical.

### Practitioner creative heuristics

Use these as starting points, not ranking rules:

- communicate one dominant fantasy or action;
- prioritize subject, action, emotion, and contrast over clutter;
- make the image understandable at actual display size;
- use honest in-game content and visual fidelity;
- avoid tiny text and UI-like thumbnail layouts;
- use title wording for searchable clarity and differentiation, not keyword stuffing;
- test whether the package attracts players who actually enjoy the first session.

**Design specifics (heuristic):**
- Simple backgrounds. Clutter kills CTR.
- 1–2 characters (3 only if the composition demands it; more is visual noise).
- High color contrast: bright subjects popping off the background (yellow character on clear blue sky).
- Exaggerated, instantly readable emotions: manic evil smile, crying/stressed face, troll face.
- Tease a mechanic over the title: text like "Steal at Night" or "Cure the Survivors" gives context and intrigue; the game's name alone usually does not.

**Proven thumbnail formats (heuristic):**
1. **Before & after:** noob vs. pro, cheap vs. expensive split. Works for tycoons and progression games.
2. **First-person perspective:** viewer inside the action. Works for PVP, shooters, RP.
3. **Two-character scene:** conflict or interaction, someone getting outplayed.
4. **One character + action:** maximally readable and simple.
5. **Entirely new concept:** unique to your game's mechanic; highest risk, highest differentiation.

**Creation workflow (heuristic):**
1. Research genre tropes in top games of the niche (e.g., hacker games: masks, green binary, brand rivalries).
2. Rough mockup in a free tool (basic shapes, clip art, text) to fix the layout before committing to detail.
3. Generate or commission from the mockup with a highly specific scene prompt.
4. Iterate with explicit direction ("remove the clouds", "make text larger", "flip the character").
5. Simplify for mobile first. Detailed desktop thumbnails are often unreadable on phones.

**Testing:** A/B test 2–3 thumbnails per week. CTR naturally decays as impressions accumulate, so keep rotating fresh, readable thumbnails. Test around major game or content updates, then let the winner stabilize.

Optional tools:

- [qptr.io](https://qptr.io) previews an icon or thumbnail beside simulated neighbors. It does not measure live Roblox performance.
- [Creator Exchange](https://creatorexchange.io) offers directional market and game estimates. It is not an official Roblox analytics source.

## 7. Monetization With Trust

Good monetization exposes clear value to willing players while the free core remains enjoyable.

Design principles:

- transparent storefront and purchase result;
- several price points and a mix of durable and consumable value;
- no hard-coded Robux prices when Managed Pricing can change them;
- regional pricing where appropriate;
- no deceptive odds, false urgency, disguised purchase buttons, repeated interruption, or punishment for declining;
- no sale that corrupts competitive integrity unless the game's promise clearly supports it;
- server-authoritative granting and idempotent receipt handling.

Price optimization requires enough transactions for statistically useful data. Roblox says it usually needs at least 60,000 transactions over the preceding 30 days. Smaller games should use qualitative value research and carefully scoped experiments rather than pretending a tiny sample proves an optimal price.

When the economy or monetization health is in question, load `roblox-analytics` for the telemetry-first decision layer: sink/source ratio, inflation, whale concentration, and the diagnose-with-telemetry workflow. Telemetry tells you what broke; the design fix is yours.

Cross-reference `roblox-monetization`, `roblox-security`, and `roblox-data` before implementing purchases.

### Practitioner monetization mental model (supplementary)

A live-game operator's playbook for dev products, from a game that grew revenue ~3x on the same player base. Experience-based; not official Roblox guidance.

**Data first, then hypothesize.** Before touching products, sort dev product sales descending and identify the best seller. Form a hypothesis for the next product from data and observed behavior, ship it, check results (revenue AND side effects), keep or revert. Do not design products on instinct.

**Watch live play, not just numbers.** Your game won't always be played as intended: operators found players running an active game AFK (and getting robbed in PvP), which surfaced a real friction point. Combine dashboard data with observation and player feedback (Creator Dashboard > audience feedback) to find the pains worth solving.

**Convert valuable game passes into consumables.** 2x offline earnings, 2x cash, and similar high-value boosts are usually implemented as one-time game passes, but that caps the **7-day spend days per user** stat (number of unique days in 7 days a user spends Robux in your experience). Consumables (repeat-purchase dev products, like consumer packaged goods: toothpaste, supplements) pump that stat: players buy a 24-hour lock today, tomorrow, the next day. A consumable that solves a real friction point almost always becomes the top seller. Experiment with consumables aggressively.

**Products should be must-haves that solve a pain, not nice-to-haves.** Best sellers are pain-relievers:
- effort grind → buy speed/cash (pain of effort);
- losing progress while AFK → base lock / protection (pain of safety);
- fear of missing out → 2x offline earnings (pain of missing out on gains);
- status/looks → limited-stock cosmetics (pain of "looking like a casual"). Limiteds with real scarcity (only 100 for sale) outsell unlimited cosmetics.

**Place products at points of interest (POI), not just in the HUD.** Put physical dev products where foot traffic is highest (e.g., at the base entrance the player walks through constantly). Swap the paid product with the free one so the paid version sits at the highest-traffic spot. In addition: time the prompt at the decision moment (offer 2x offline earnings right when the player walks over the collect point; cheap 19-Robux upsell).

**Improve purchase pathways.** Multiple ways to reach the shop increase sales: HUD shop icon, a "+" cash button next to the currency display, and (after 3 failed buy attempts) an automatic cash-shop popup. First two "not enough money" errors show a soft error; on the third, open the shop. Keep the popup non-intrusive (cap per session). UI and physical in-world pickups both count as pathways.

**Check for collateral damage.** After shipping a product, check it didn't wreck other stats: playtime, D1, D7, session time, first-time user experience, and the in-game economy (over-priced currency or 2x boosts can destroy progression balance). Economy-destroying prices (e.g., $1B cash for 9 Robux) cook the game long-term.

## 8. Social Design and LiveOps

Social features are not automatically retention features. Define the interaction:

- collaboration, competition, spectatorship, gifting, trading, parties, guilds, or shared creation;
- how solo and new players avoid exclusion;
- moderation and abuse controls;
- scam-resistant trade and gift flows, reporting, and escalation;
- mandatory filtering for player-authored text and the review burden of uploaded content;
- griefing controls that preserve legitimate competition;
- whether server size and matchmaking support the intended behavior;
- how co-play is measured without manufacturing friction.

### 8.1 LiveOps taxonomy (official)

LiveOps is the post-launch support that maintains engagement. Four update types, in increasing scope:

1. **Content cadence**: regular release of fresh content (weekly to monthly), building on existing systems: limited-time events, seasonal content, UGC. Cheap to produce, maintains engagement between major updates, concentrates programming resources on the next major.
2. **Major updates**: new or expanded systems that change gameplay: social systems (guilds, trading), competitive systems (PVP, leaderboards, tournaments), collections/achievements, large live events aimed at re-engaging lapsed players. Months of development; retain existing players and attract new ones.
3. **Quality-of-life improvements**: polish: UI layouts, UX flows, aesthetic refreshes, accessibility, performance. Can have outsized goodwill impact; gather player feedback on frustrations and time sinks.
4. **Bug fixes**: implementation issues. Prioritize by severity (impact on gameplay), effort, and number of players affected.

Blend all four; cadence keeps the game fresh, majors evolve it, QoL buys goodwill, bug fixes preserve trust. The precise cadence depends on the team's capability and the game's systems; balance player desires against what can be reliably delivered.

**Content cadence sustainability (official).** Keep cadence releases cheap and maintainable:

- **Choose correct content**: items, furniture, pets, vehicles, weapons, maps, quests are predominantly art-based, requiring little programming or design. Simple variants (color changes) are ideal. Themed releases (seasonal, holiday, around a central concept) unlock cross-item creativity. Use analytics and player feedback to target high-value content.
- **Manage scope**: spend under three weeks of effort per cadence release so the schedule stays rapid and leaves room for other LiveOps. Adding new systems to support a release turns cadence into an expansion and becomes unsustainable.
- **Establish a routine**: a regular cadence (common: every two weeks to a month) makes players check back and anticipate releases; it also makes the team more efficient with practice.
- **Prioritize sustainability**: content should not be immediately consumable by most players, or the team is forced to over-release. Deliver sustainably through: progression (add permanent content near endgame where veterans run out of objectives), limited-time content (available to all for an event; earn via quests/milestones/event currency, balanced so it takes most players weeks to exhaust), and season passes (the standard delivery vehicle: quest-based, with free and premium tiers).

### 8.2 Planning (official)

- **KPIs**: pick the metric you want to impact (e.g. daily active users) before designing the update. Events usually move several KPIs at once.
- **Player actions**: define the intended player actions during the event and the KPIs those actions influence.
- **Economy impact**: increased interaction can change earning/spending patterns. Design rewards so they don't damage the economy (e.g. a fishing tournament that exposes a currency-earning loop must not hand out rewards that break price levels).
- **Communication**: plan external (social, community) and internal (popups, UI, lobby) communication, and its timing. Advance notice lets players schedule their return; waiting too long risks being overlooked.
- **Monitor and analyze**: track currency sources/sinks; make data timely (hourly or same-day checks during launch), comparable (compare event weeks to pre/post event weeks), and use it to confirm the event is hitting goals without granting too much.

### 8.3 Practitioner heuristics (supplementary)

From a practitioner with a live 21K CCU game (~$131K/mo). Experience, not official guidance:

- **Patch vs update track**: patches (bugs, exploits, nerfs/buffs, monetization tweaks) ship daily if needed; never wait for a weekly window. Updates ship weekly/bi-weekly and each names its metric before work starts.
- **Three data sources**: qualitative (Discord bug reports, community forum, Creator Dashboard Feedback tab AI summary), quantitative (dashboard analytics), competitor research (mine your core audience's server tags and past games to find what they play beyond the recommendation feed).
- **Core audience**: dedicated playtesters who out-play you. Plan and playtest with them, but discern: they are players, not game designers. The player is usually right, not always.
- **Cadence**: launch, plan next same day, assign next day, build midweek, playtest internal then core on Friday, launch Saturday.
- **Dos/don'ts**: listen and talk to your audience; test before launch; watch small YouTubers play (sort by posted today, low views) to find friction; prefer internal team over big studio when resources allow; don't prioritize monetization over gameplay (pay-to-win kills); don't do last-second updates; don't please everyone or implement every suggestion (can fry the economy); don't get lazy ("we made it, don't need to touch it" kills games); don't push updates that create no engagement.
- **Sunk cost fallacy**: players keep playing due to invested time/money/effort; design updates that deepen emotional investment in progress (e.g. build mode where new players build safely before facing pressure).
- **Retention lens**: Roblox discovery accounts are D28: continuous content keeps the algorithm feeding fresh engagement.

LiveOps should complement or deepen the core loop. For each event or update, define:

- target audience and KPI;
- intended player actions;
- economy sources, sinks, and reward impact;
- communication before and during the event;
- hourly health checks during launch;
- comparison with pre-event and post-event periods;
- what remains after the temporary event ends.

Do not use event spikes as proof of durable retention. Compare later cohorts and ordinary weeks.

## 9. Audit Workflow

When asked to audit a Roblox game:

### Step 1: Request evidence

Ask for what exists, not an idealized dashboard dump:

- game link and intended audience;
- Home recommendation impressions, play through, bounce, play days, playtime, and important signals;
- acquisition by source;
- first-session retention and onboarding funnel;
- D1, D7, and D30 cohorts;
- session time and playtime;
- payer conversion, ARPDAU, ARPPU, products, and economy health;
- device, locale, and country/region breakdowns;
- errors, crashes, frame rate, and recent update dates;
- thumbnails, icon, title, description, and reduced-exposure banner;
- player feedback and observed sessions.

### Step 2: Establish the baseline

Separate facts, inferences, and unknowns. Mark immature D7/D30 cohorts. Note seasonality, traffic-source changes, events, ads, and releases.

### Step 3: Find the narrowest broken transition

Examples:

- impression → play;
- join → player control;
- control → first meaningful action;
- action → first reward;
- reward → core-loop completion;
- first session → return;
- retained player → value-aware shop visit;
- purchase intent → completed purchase.

### Step 4: Prioritize

Use a simple evidence-weighted score:

> **Priority = expected player impact × confidence × reach ÷ cost and risk**

Do not fabricate precision. A qualitative High/Medium/Low score is often more honest.

### Step 5: Produce an experiment backlog

For each recommendation include:

- evidence and uncertainty;
- hypothesis;
- smallest viable change;
- primary metric and guardrails;
- eligible cohort and segmentation;
- instrumentation required;
- expected decision date;
- rollback trigger.

### Step 6: Preserve the game's identity

Optimization is not a license to turn every game into the same simulator loop. Protect the intended fantasy, audience, tone, accessibility, and creative distinction. Reject metric gains that depend on misleading acquisition or damaged player trust.

## 10. Output Format

Use this structure for a game-design diagnosis:

1. **Verdict:** the highest-leverage constraint.
2. **Evidence:** verified facts and the source/date range.
3. **Unknowns:** missing evidence that could change the diagnosis.
4. **Hypotheses:** ranked, not stated as facts.
5. **Next experiment:** one smallest interpretable intervention.
6. **Metrics:** primary outcome, counter-metrics, and decision rule.
7. **Implementation routing:** which Roblox Brain skills are needed.
8. **Later backlog:** useful work deliberately excluded from the first test.
