# Roblox Security & Anti-Exploit


> **Code in this reference is illustrative. Adapt to your game and verify in Studio before production use.**

Use this skill when designing security systems, auditing existing code for vulnerabilities, or hardening a game against common exploit vectors.

## Core Principle

**The client is compromised. Always.** Exploiters run arbitrary Luau on the client via injection tools. Every LocalScript, every ReplicatedStorage module, and every client-side value is readable and writable by attackers. The server is the source of truth, but the implementation depends on the authority model.

## Authority Models

### Classic replication

Validate client requests and custom movement against server-owned state. Do not trust client-reported damage, currency, inventory, permissions, or positions. Network ownership is a physics simulation choice, not a complete security boundary.

### Server Authority

Server Authority is an opt-in Roblox model configured through `Workspace.AuthorityMode = Server` and the required replication, fixed-simulation, streaming, and input settings. The server remains authoritative for core gameplay while clients predict input and recover from misprediction through rollback and resimulation.

For Server Authority projects:

- put synchronized simulation logic in `RunService:BindToSimulation()` (requires `Workspace.UseFixedSimulation` enabled in Studio);
- use the Input Action System for inputs that affect the core simulation;
- do not write simulation-access properties such as `BasePart.CFrame` from a `Heartbeat` handler as a substitute for authoritative simulation;
- keep validation for custom attacks, dashes, teleports, purchases, permissions, and other game-specific actions at the server boundary;
- use `RunService:SetPredictionMode()` only when the game's prediction policy needs explicit control.

See the [Server Authority model](https://create.roblox.com/docs/projects/server-authority) and [advanced techniques](https://create.roblox.com/docs/projects/server-authority/techniques).

### Server Authority migration reality check

The official docs read like a flag flip, but the real cost depends on how much simulation you author. Practitioner experience is two-sided, so do not assume either extreme:

- **Stock/off-the-shelf characters with little custom simulation:** migration can be genuinely simple. A beta tester who ran the API for over a year described flipping the switch for stock Humanoids as a minor change in most cases.
- **Authored simulation (fighting games, custom movement/physics, rollback-style mechanics):** budget like a rewrite, not a configuration change. One practitioner porting a rollback fighter that was already simulation-compatible spent over a month getting back to feature parity, and warns the integration is not something you can cleanly undo once started. If the project cannot afford that, prefer classic replication with server-side validation instead.

Practical constraints once you commit:

- **Sources of truth must be independent and deterministic.** Reconstruct state from synchronized `time()`-derived keys, not from live attributes. Keep a per-frame snapshot of the minimum state needed to resimulate, and after a rollback discard snapshots newer than the reconciled frame.
- **Attributes are the serialization channel and they budget hard.** The attribute payload is roughly 1 KiB; a few CFrames or Vector3s can consume it. Pack dense numeric state into bit flags (32 bits per value; split a 64-bit Lua number with `math.fmod` if you need two) instead of storing floats.
- **Client input can be rolled back.** Do not rely on a single input event reaching the simulation. Re-parse buffered input each frame so a misprediction retries instead of dropping the action, and expect a small input delay buffer in real-time games.
- **Side effects are the sharpest edge.** Anything non-deterministic (UI toggles, spawns, one-shot events) fires again on resimulation unless transitions are idempotent. Beta testers call side effects the biggest pain point and recommend observing attribute changes during `PreRender` rather than reacting inside the simulation where you cannot tell a re-run from a first run.

Practitioner-sourced synthesis (not official API documentation): the nightmare account that motivated this is at <https://devforum.roblox.com/t/server-authority-client-beta-was-a-damn-nightmare-heres-some-advice/4712758>; the official [Server Authority model](https://create.roblox.com/docs/projects/server-authority) and [advanced techniques](https://create.roblox.com/docs/projects/server-authority/techniques) docs remain the API source of truth.

## Exploit Vectors & Mitigations

### Movement and physics exploits

| Attack | How it works | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Speed or fly exploit | Client attempts to control movement outside the game's allowed state | In Server Authority, use the engine's server-authoritative simulation and prediction model. In classic projects, validate custom movement transitions with tolerance for seats, respawns, teleports, and correction. |
| Teleport or noclip | Client requests or produces an impossible game-specific transition | Validate the requested action and the server's state, rather than blindly snapping `CFrame` every frame. Record suspicion and investigate repeated violations instead of punishing one lag spike. |

Do not copy a blanket `Heartbeat` position checker into a Server Authority project. The server already owns the authoritative simulation, and writing simulation-access properties outside the simulation callback can error. If a classic project needs custom movement checks, keep the checker aware of legitimate state transitions and clean all per-player state on `PlayerRemoving`.

### Server-side anticheat (classic replication)

Server-side anticheats detect movement abuse by checking sustained airborne time and jump-ceiling violations (flight), horizontal velocity above a threshold using relative velocity so moving platforms don't false-flag (speed), single-tick jumps and accumulated positional drift (teleport), raycasts through collidable geometry (noclip), and consecutive angular/linear velocity spikes (fling). Structure checks as small modules exposing an id, weight, state, and a `check(state, delta)` function; tune thresholds with a ~1.5x multiplier to absorb replication quirks, and add a history record that lowers thresholds for repeat offenders. Treat these as weakening measures, not a silver bullet: subtle sub-threshold exploits slip through, and Server Authority remains the robust answer for physics-based exploits.

### Remote Exploits

| Attack | How it works | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Remote spam | Fire remotes at extreme rates | Per-player rate limiter |
| Argument spoofing | Send wrong types/values | Validate every argument type and range |
| Remote sniffing | Read remote names to reverse-engineer API | Doesn't matter if validation is solid |
| Replay attack | Re-fire a valid remote call | Idempotency checks, transaction IDs |

For the rate limiter and argument validation implementations, see `roblox-networking`.

### Economy Exploits

| Attack | How it works | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Item duplication | Race condition in trade/save | Session locking, atomic operations |
| Negative purchase | Send negative quantity to gain items | Validate quantity > 0 server-side |
| Transaction replay | Replay a purchase remote | Unique transaction IDs, check if already processed |
| DataStore rollback | Exploit save timing to duplicate | Session locking with server JobId |

### DataStore Exploits

| Attack | How it works | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Save spam | Force repeated saves to exhaust budget | Server-controlled save intervals only |
| Session hijack | Fake session to duplicate across servers | Session lock with JobId verification |
| BindToClose skip | Exploit shutdown timing | BindToClose with parallel saves + timeout |
| Unsaveable payload | Remote accepts Instance/userdata into saved tables; save throws and rolls back | Validate every persisted field's type at the remote boundary; never store client-supplied tables unvalidated |
| Malformed string | Invalid UTF-8 bytes pass type checks but fail serialization | `utf8.len(value)` must return a count before persisting client strings |
| NaN rollback | NaN smuggled through settings remotes breaks serializers or comparisons, rolling back saves | Reject `x ~= x` and infinities wherever client numbers enter persisted state |

[ ] Leaderboard values computed server-side
[ ] Anti-AFK detection for reward systems
[ ] Chat filter applied (TextService:FilterStringAsync)
```

## Patterns

### Never Trust Client Values

```luau
-- BAD: Client tells server how much damage to deal
DamageRemote.OnServerEvent:Connect(function(player, target, damage)
    target.Humanoid:TakeDamage(damage) -- exploiter sends 999999
end)

-- GOOD: Server computes damage from game state
AttackRemote.OnServerEvent:Connect(function(player, targetId)
    local weapon = getEquippedWeapon(player)
    if not weapon then return end
    local target = resolveTarget(targetId)
    if not target then return end
    if not isInRange(player, target, weapon.Range) then return end
    if not checkCooldown(player, weapon) then return end

    local damage = weapon.BaseDamage * getDamageMultiplier(player)
    target.Humanoid:TakeDamage(damage)
end)
```

### Session Locking

Do not implement session ownership as a bare `game.JobId` field. A lock without
expiry, heartbeat, stale-owner handling, and crash recovery can block a profile
forever. Use a maintained profile library, or implement the complete protocol
described in `roblox-data`. Do not layer a second lock over a library that
already owns the profile lifecycle.

### Sanity Checks (Defense in Depth)

Even with server authority, add sanity checks for values that should be bounded. These protect custom state and remote arguments; they are not a replacement for the Server Authority simulation model:

```luau
-- Clamp values that should never exceed known bounds
local function sanitizePlayerStats(stats)
    stats.Level = math.clamp(stats.Level, 1, MAX_LEVEL)
    stats.Gold = math.max(stats.Gold, 0) -- never negative
    stats.Health = math.clamp(stats.Health, 0, stats.MaxHealth)
    return stats
end
```

## What NOT to Do

- **Don't obfuscate client code**: it doesn't stop exploiters and makes debugging harder
- **Don't use _G for security state**: it's globally readable and writable
- **Don't kick without logging**: you need data to distinguish false positives from real exploits
- **Don't over-validate movement**: too strict = legitimate players get false-flagged on lag spikes, and blanket checks fight Server Authority prediction. Use the selected model's simulation path and tolerate legitimate corrections.
- **Don't rely on client-side anti-cheat**: exploiters disable it first
