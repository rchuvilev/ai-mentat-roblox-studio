This skill is about finding and fixing problems, not just writing code. It focuses on the tools and habits that separate working experiences from broken ones.

## When to use this skill

Activate when:
- Something is not behaving as expected (scripts, UI, physics, data, networking).
- Frame rate, memory, or server heartbeat is degrading.
- Setting up unit tests or reproducible test cases.
- Trying to isolate whether a bug is on the client or server.
- Debugging a live issue using the Developer Console.

- [roblox-datastores/SKILL.md](../roblox-datastores/SKILL.md) for DataStore retry patterns and debugging data store errors.
- [roblox-physics/SKILL.md](../roblox-physics/SKILL.md) for debugging physics ownership and sleep.

## The debugging mindset

1. **Reproduce it.** If you can't reproduce it, you can't fix it.
2. **Isolate it.** Remove systems until the bug disappears; the last thing removed is the cause.
3. **Measure it.** Use tools instead of guessing.
4. **Fix one thing at a time.** Verify the fix and add a regression test if possible.
5. **Log defensively.** Good logs make future debugging faster.

## Logging discipline

Use `print`, `warn`, and `error` deliberately:
- `print` for normal diagnostics.
- `warn` for recoverable problems you should notice.
- `error` for programming errors that should stop execution.

Include context in log messages:

```lua
warn(string.format("[DataStore] Save failed for %d: %s", userId, tostring(err)))
```

Avoid logging secrets, player data, or PII.

## pcall and assertions

Wrap fallible calls, especially cloud services, HTTP, DataStores, Marketplace:

```lua
local ok, result = pcall(function()
    return someService:DoSomething()
end)
if not ok then
    warn("DoSomething failed:", result)
end
```

Use `assert` for internal invariants that should never fail:

```lua
assert(config.MaxSpeed > 0, "MaxSpeed must be positive")
```

## Developer Console

Open with `F9` in-game or in Studio play mode.

Tabs:
- **Log** — client/server output, errors, warnings.
- **Memory** — categorized memory usage.
- **Network** — HTTP and service requests.
- **Server Stats** — heartbeat, ping, data ping.
- **Script Profiler** — record script CPU usage.
- **MicroProfiler** — capture server dumps.

Toggle Client/Server views to see which side emitted output.

## Unit testing with TestEZ

The standard Roblox testing framework is [TestEZ](https://github.com/Roblox/testez). It supports nested `describe`/`it` blocks, lifecycle hooks, async tests, and a rich matcher API.

TestEZ example:

```lua
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local TestEZ = require(ReplicatedStorage.DevPackages.TestEZ)

local MathUtils = require(ReplicatedStorage.MathUtils)

describe("MathUtils", function()
    it("clamps values", function()
        expect(MathUtils.clamp(5, 0, 10)).to.equal(5)
        expect(MathUtils.clamp(-1, 0, 10)).to.equal(0)
        expect(MathUtils.clamp(11, 0, 10)).to.equal(10)
    end)
end)

TestEZ.TestBootstrap:run({ game.ReplicatedStorage.Tests })
```

For legacy in-Studio tests, `TestService:Error(msg)` can mark failures visibly in Studio output, but most projects should prefer TestEZ. The scripts folder contains a minimal `TestRunner.lua` shim only for environments where TestEZ is unavailable.

## Luau type checking

Use the [Luau language server](https://luau.org/) (`luau-lsp`) or the Luau type checker in Studio to catch errors before runtime.

Best practices:
- Add type annotations to module exports and pure functions.
- Run `luau-lsp analyze` in CI or before committing.
- Enable `--!strict` for new modules.
- Do not over-type untyped engine APIs; prefer casts at boundaries.

## Studio Debugger

Use Studio's built-in debugger for step-through debugging:
- Set breakpoints by clicking the gutter next to a line number.
- Run in **Play** mode and use the debugger controls to step over, into, or out.
- Inspect the call stack, local variables, and upvalues in the debugger panel.
- The debugger works in both client and server contexts when Studio runs both.

## xpcall and debug.traceback

Use `xpcall` with `debug.traceback` to capture full stack traces from failures:

```lua
local ok, err = xpcall(function()
    riskyOperation()
end, debug.traceback)
if not ok then
    warn(err)
end
```

This is especially useful at top-level entry points, scheduled callbacks, and connection handlers where `pcall` alone discards the stack.

## Connection cleanup

Leaked `RBXScriptConnection` objects are a common source of memory leaks and stale state. Prefer explicit cleanup patterns:

- Use a Maid/Janitor-style collector:

```lua
local Maid = require(path.to.Maid)
local maid = Maid.new()

maid:GiveTask(workspace.ChildAdded:Connect(onChild))
maid:GiveTask(RunService.Heartbeat:Connect(onStep))

maid:Destroy() -- disconnects everything
```

- Use `:Once()` for one-shot event handlers.
- Use `Instance.Destroying` to trigger cleanup when an instance is removed:

```lua
obj.Destroying:Connect(function()
    cleanup()
end)
```

- Always pair `:Connect()` with a matching `:Disconnect()` or destruction.

## Prefer task over spawn/delay

The `task` library is more predictable than legacy `spawn`, `delay`, and `wait`:

```lua
-- good
task.wait(1)
task.delay(1, callback)
task.spawn(coroutineOrFn)

-- avoid
spawn(callback)
delay(1, callback)
wait(1)
```

`task.defer` is useful for yielding to the next resumption cycle without opening a new thread.

## Log rate limiting and secrets hygiene

- Never log secrets, keys, user identifiers, or personal information.
- Sanitize values before logging:

```lua
local function sanitize(value)
    if typeof(value) == "Instance" and value:IsA("Player") then
        return "Player(" .. tostring(value.UserId) .. ")"
    end
    return value
end
```

- Rate-limit noisy logs to avoid flooding the console and network:

```lua
local lastLog = 0
local function throttledLog(message)
    local now = os.clock()
    if now - lastLog > 5 then
        lastLog = now
        warn(message)
    end
end
```

## Network ownership

Incorrect network ownership causes jittery physics and replication lag. Visualize ownership and assign it explicitly:

```lua
-- Server
part:SetNetworkOwner(player)

-- Client-side visualization (debug only)
local ownershipLabel -- create BillboardGui or use DebugDraw
```

Use `BasePart:GetNetworkOwner()` to inspect ownership. Vehicles and held items should usually be owned by the controlling player.

## DataStore retry pattern

Wrap DataStore calls with exponential backoff and jitter:

```lua
local function dataStoreWithRetry(fn, maxAttempts)
    maxAttempts = maxAttempts or 5
    for attempt = 1, maxAttempts do
        local ok, result = pcall(fn)
        if ok then
            return true, result
        elseif attempt == maxAttempts then
            return false, result
        else
            warn("DataStore attempt " .. attempt .. " failed; retrying...")
            task.wait(2 ^ attempt * 0.1 + math.random() * 0.5)
        end
    end
end
```

Always call DataStores from the server and validate serialization before saving.

## Memory snapshot comparison

Use the Developer Console Memory tab or Scene Analysis to compare snapshots:

1. Capture a baseline snapshot in a stable state.
2. Play through the action that may leak (spawn/despawn enemies, open/close UI).
3. Return to the stable state and capture a second snapshot.
4. Compare PlaceMemory, Luau heap, and instance counts.
5. Investigate categories that did not return to baseline; look for unparented instances in Scene Analysis.

## MicroProfiler

Open with `Ctrl+F6` (`⌘+F6`) in Studio or the desktop client.

Use it to:
- Find frame-time spikes.
- Identify whether a bottleneck is script compute, physics, or rendering.
- Capture server dumps from the Developer Console.
- Add custom labels with `debug.profilebegin`/`debug.profileend`.

Key colors:
- **Orange** — worker thread (scripts, physics, animations) bottleneck.
- **Blue** — render thread bottleneck.
- **Red** — GPU wait / render complexity.

## Scene Analysis

Available in Studio under **Window → Performance Summary → Scene Analysis**.

Views:
- **Script memory** — per-script Luau heap.
- **Unparented instances** — potential memory leaks held by scripts.
- **Instance composition** — counts by category.
- **Audio/Animation memory** — asset memory usage.
- **Triangle composition** — draw call breakdown.

Scene Analysis is a Studio UI tool; there is no public `SceneAnalysisService` API.

## Script Profiler

Records CPU time per script. Use it when MicroProfiler points to scripts but you need to know which script.

## Common bug categories

| Symptom | Likely causes |
| --- | --- |
| Script silently fails | Missing `pcall`, error swallowed, wrong script context |
| Data not saving | DataStore called from client, non-serializable value, no `pcall` |
| Remote not working | Wrong side, handler not connected, argument mismatch |
| Lag spikes | Pathfinding every frame, too many particles, unbatched loops |
| Physics jitter | Wrong network ownership, assembly splits, conflicting constraints |
| NPCs stuck | Blocked path not recomputed, bad agent params, streaming issues |
| UI doesn't update | Property not replicated, wrong parent, layout order |
| Memory grows forever | Leaked connections, unparented instances, cached assets |

## Network debugging

- Check **Network** tab in Developer Console for HTTP/DataStore failures.
- Use `Shift+F3` in-game for network debug stats.
- Distinguish network ping (round-trip time) from data ping (replication queue).
- Simulate latency/jitter with Studio Network Simulation (`Alt+S`).

## Load time debugging

Measure load time:

```lua
local start = os.clock()
game.Loaded:Connect(function()
    print("Loaded in", os.clock() - start)
end)
```

Enable **Print Join Size Breakdown** in Studio Settings → Network to see the largest replicated instances.

## Scripts

- `scripts/TestRunner.lua` — a minimal TestEZ fallback with nested suites, lifecycle hooks, matchers, async support, and TestService integration.
- `scripts/Logger.lua` — a structured logger with level filtering and guarded formatting.
- `scripts/DebugDraw.lua` — utility for drawing rays, points, and boxes in 3D for visual debugging.

## How to proceed

1. Reproduce the issue reliably.
2. Check logs and errors in the Developer Console.
3. Determine client vs server scope.
4. Use MicroProfiler/Script Profiler for performance issues.
5. Use Scene Analysis for memory leaks and scene composition.
6. Add targeted logging or tests to confirm the fix.
7. Verify on low-end devices and with network simulation when relevant.
8. Compare memory snapshots before and after suspected leaks.
