## When to Load

Load when adding a remote, handling untrusted client input, implementing cooldowns, or deciding which side owns a gameplay result.

## Quick Reference

- Treat every client argument as attacker-controlled input.
- Validate type, size, ownership, state, distance, and cooldown on the server.
- Look up prices, damage, rewards, and permissions from server-owned definitions.
- Choose the authority model before designing movement or continuous simulation. Server Authority uses client input prediction and server rollback; it is not the same thing as handing a part to a client with `SetNetworkOwner`.
- For simulation-affecting input in Server Authority, use `InputAction`/`InputContext` and `RunService:BindToSimulation()` (requires `Workspace.UseFixedSimulation` enabled in Studio) rather than feeding continuous input through a `RemoteEvent`.
- Use events for most gameplay requests. Keep `RemoteFunction` calls short and bounded.
- Use `RemoteEvent` for reliable state changes within its event channel. Do not assume a RemoteEvent is ordered with property or attribute replication; use one explicit state channel or version the state when ordering matters. Use `UnreliableRemoteEvent` only for replaceable or ephemeral data such as VFX and continuous snapshots.
- Unreliable does not mean automatically faster: delivery is unordered, packets may be dropped, and payloads should stay at or below the documented 1000-byte limit.
- Measure payload size and fire rate under load. Do not treat a community packet-size estimator as an official wire-format specification.
- Validate numeric inputs for NaN and infinity (`x ~= x`, `math.abs(x) == math.huge`) before range checks: `NaN` defeats `<`/`>`. Apply the same class of check to strings: `utf8.len(s)` returns nil for malformed UTF-8 that would fail a DataStore save.
- Rate limits protect the server, but validation must still reject invalid requests.
- Record suspicious behavior and use thresholds. Do not punish a player for one malformed packet.
