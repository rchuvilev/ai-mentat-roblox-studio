# roblox animation and vfx: full reference

> Code examples are illustrative. Adapt them to your project and verify in Studio before production use.

Visual effects are a budgeted part of gameplay, not decoration added after performance work. Build them around an owner, a trigger, a duration, and a cleanup path.

## 1. Animation loading

Use an `Animator` under the character's `Humanoid` or under an `AnimationController` for non-character rigs. Keep asset IDs in configuration and verify that the experience has permission to use them.

```luau
local function loadTrack(animator: Animator, assetId: string, priority: Enum.AnimationPriority): AnimationTrack
    local animation = Instance.new("Animation")
    animation.AnimationId = assetId
    local track = animator:LoadAnimation(animation)
    track.Priority = priority
    return track
end
```

Load the track when the character or prop is created, not in a hot input path. A missing or unavailable asset should leave the gameplay state valid and produce a useful warning.

The helper above is a useful classic or local-presentation pattern. In a Server Authority project, do not treat an `AnimationTrack` reference as a permanent identity: rollback or resimulation can stop or replace the visible track. Store the animation ID in state and query the current animator tracks when applying changes, for example with `Animator:GetPlayingAnimationTracks()` or `Animator:GetTrackByAnimationId()`.

## Server Authority animation and effects

When an animation affects synchronized gameplay, mirror its control logic on the client and server in a shared module and run the synchronized part through `RunService:BindToSimulation()` (requires `Workspace.UseFixedSimulation` enabled in Studio). Keep camera, particles, sounds, and other presentation work outside the simulation callback so it can respond to the current predicted state.

Predicted effects must be reversible. A client can briefly predict an impact, explosion, or sound that the server later rejects. Drive durable presentation from synchronized state or a state machine, and cancel or hide effects when rollback changes that state. Do not let a predicted effect grant damage, rewards, or other gameplay outcomes.

## 2. Priorities and markers

Use animation priority to define which tracks may override the same joints. Keep locomotion and action tracks separate. Use marker signals for synchronized effects instead of guessing a timestamp that changes when an animation is retuned. In Server Authority, resolve the current track after rollback rather than assuming a cached track handle still represents the visible animation.

```luau
local attack = loadTrack(animator, ATTACK_ID, Enum.AnimationPriority.Action)

local markerConnection = attack:GetMarkerReachedSignal("Impact"):Connect(function(value)
    Effects:PlayImpact(character, value)
end)

attack.Stopped:Once(function()
    markerConnection:Disconnect()
end)
attack:Play(0.08)
```

If the animation can be stopped and restarted, make the effect trigger idempotent or clear the previous attack state before playing again.

## 3. Blending

Use a short fade when moving between locomotion states. Stop tracks that should no longer contribute. A track that remains playing at a low weight still consumes state and can make later debugging difficult.

Keep the state machine responsible for selecting tracks. The effect system should react to a named event such as `Footstep` or `Impact`, not inspect every animation frame.

## 4. Particle emitters

For a continuous effect, tune `Rate`, `Lifetime`, `Speed`, `Size`, and `Color`. For a one-shot effect, keep emission manual:

```luau
local emitter = template:Clone()
emitter.Rate = 0
emitter.Parent = attachment
emitter:Emit(18)

task.delay(2, function()
    if emitter.Parent then
        emitter:Destroy()
    end
end)
```

Use `NumberSequence` and `ColorSequence` to move size, transparency, and color over lifetime. Keep lifetime and rate low enough that a repeated effect cannot accumulate unbounded particles. Prefer a small set of reusable templates over creating new textures and emitters for every hit.

## 5. Beams and trails

Both effects depend on attachments. Put the attachments on stable parts, and verify their orientation and lifetime when the model is animated.

```luau
local startAttachment = source:FindFirstChild("BeamStart")
local endAttachment = target:FindFirstChild("BeamEnd")
if not startAttachment or not endAttachment then
    return
end

local beam = beamTemplate:Clone()
beam.Attachment0 = startAttachment
beam.Attachment1 = endAttachment
beam.Parent = source

Debris:AddItem(beam, 0.35)
```

A trail records movement between its attachments. If the attachments are destroyed or teleported unexpectedly, the visual can stretch or disappear. Remove the trail with the owning projectile or character.

## 6. Tweening

`TweenService` is useful for UI, transparency, color, size, and camera-adjacent feedback. Keep the target properties explicit and retain the tween if you need to cancel it on a state change.

```luau
local TweenService = game:GetService("TweenService")
local tween = TweenService:Create(
    flashPart,
    TweenInfo.new(0.2, Enum.EasingStyle.Quad, Enum.EasingDirection.Out),
    { Transparency = 1 }
)

tween:Play()
tween.Completed:Once(function()
    if flashPart.Parent then
        flashPart:Destroy()
    end
end)
```

Do not start a new tween every render frame for a value that could be computed once. When a state changes quickly, cancel or replace the old tween rather than allowing several competing animations to finish.

## 7. Lighting and camera feedback

Short-lived color correction, bloom, blur, or camera shake should be subtle and owned by the local player. Keep gameplay logic independent of the visual effect so a disabled effect does not change damage, movement, or reward results.

For camera shake, combine small offsets around the current camera transform and decay the amplitude. Avoid permanently setting `CameraType` or replacing the camera's subject without a restoration path.

## 8. Pooling and cleanup

Pool effects that fire frequently, such as muzzle flashes, hit sparks, and footsteps. A pool should reset every mutable property before reuse:

- parent and enabled state;
- attachments and adornments;
- transparency, color, and size sequences;
- active tweens and connections;
- expiration timestamp.

Use `Debris` for a simple one-shot lifetime. Use an explicit owner object when the effect has multiple connections or must be cancelled early.

## 9. Preloading and runtime failure

Preload only the assets needed for an imminent experience state. Preloading an entire catalog increases memory pressure and still does not make an unavailable asset valid. Show a fallback when an animation, image, sound, or particle texture cannot load.

## 10. Review checklist

- [ ] Every animation uses an `Animator` and a verified asset ID.
- [ ] Track priority and stopping behavior are intentional.
- [ ] Markers or named gameplay events drive synchronized effects.
- [ ] Bursts have bounded count and lifetime.
- [ ] Beam and trail attachments survive for the effect's lifetime.
- [ ] Tweens are replaced or cancelled when state changes.
- [ ] Temporary instances, connections, and tasks have an owner.
- [ ] Effects are tested on the target device class and in a real playtest.
