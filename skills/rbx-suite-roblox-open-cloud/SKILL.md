Open Cloud is the REST API surface for Roblox resources. It lets you build command-line tools, web apps, CI/CD pipelines, scheduled jobs, and external automation that read and write the same resources your live game servers use — without spinning up a game server.

Cross-reference:
- [roblox-datastores/SKILL.md](../roblox-datastores/SKILL.md) — in-engine DataStore API; Open Cloud Data Stores is the external counterpart.
- [roblox-gamepasses/SKILL.md](../roblox-gamepasses/SKILL.md) — game passes, developer products, and subscriptions also have Open Cloud management endpoints.
- [roblox-networking/SKILL.md](../roblox-networking/SKILL.md) — for in-experience HTTP via `HttpService` and the security model around outbound requests.
- [roblox-core/SKILL.md](../roblox-core/SKILL.md) — services, `HttpService`, script contexts.

## When to use this skill

Activate when:
- Building external automation that reads/writes Roblox resources (data stores, places, assets, groups, users).
- Implementing CI/CD for place publishing or asset upload.
- Doing bulk data operations (migration, cleanup, RTBF deletion, snapshot/restore) at a scale that's painful from in-engine scripts.
- Receiving webhook notifications (subscription purchased/refunded/renewed, etc.).
- Calling Open Cloud endpoints from inside a live game server via `HttpService` (e.g. updating a group membership from in-experience).
- Managing API keys, OAuth 2.0 clients, or secrets for Roblox automation.

Do **not** use Open Cloud for what the in-engine API already does well inside a running server (normal DataStore reads/writes, Marketplace prompts, etc.). Use it for the things the engine *can't* do: external triggers, bulk ops, cross-experience tooling, scheduled jobs, and webhooks.

## Authentication

Three auth models, in order of preference:

### 1. API keys (recommended for most automation)

All Open Cloud APIs accept an `x-api-key` header containing an API key string. Create keys on the [Creator Dashboard → API Keys](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/credentials?activeTab=ApiKeysTab) page.

- A key's access is determined by the **permissions of the user who owns it** — it can reach any resource that user can, including their personal experiences and any group-owned experiences where they have the right role.
- Some scopes can be restricted to specific experiences; not all.
- **Best practices** (from the official docs):
  - Create **separate keys per application** to isolate blast radius.
  - Select the **minimum permissions** needed; restrict scope to specific experiences where possible.
  - Use **IP restrictions** (CIDR notation) — but **not** when calling from Roblox game servers (Roblox server IPs aren't known/predictable).
  - Set **expiration dates** for short-term keys; avoid them for long-term use without a rotation process.
  - **Never** store keys in source control, scripts, or public channels. Use a secrets manager; in Roblox places use a [Secrets Store](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/cloud-services/secrets).
  - For **group-owned resources**, create a dedicated alternate account with only the target group access and generate the key there — don't use your personal account's key for group automation.

### 2. OAuth 2.0 (for apps acting on behalf of other users)

Use OAuth 2.0 when your app needs to act on behalf of a Roblox user who isn't you (e.g. a third-party tool a creator logs into). See https://create.roblox.com/docs/cloud/auth/oauth2-overview. Has stronger stability guarantees and regular updates.

### 3. Legacy cookie auth (avoid)

Legacy APIs use cookie-based auth, can break without notice, and have minimal stability guarantees. **Not recommended for production.** Only use for one-off internal tooling where breakage is acceptable.

## API key lifecycle

API keys have these statuses (from the official docs):

| Status | Reason | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Active | No issues. | N/A |
| Disabled | You toggled **Enable Key** off. | Toggle it back on. |
| Expired | Expiration date passed. | Remove or set a new expiration. |
| Auto-Expired | **Unused or unmodified for 60 days** (even without a set expiration). | Disable then re-enable, or update any property. |
| Revoked | Group key: the generating account lost group access. | Regenerate the key. |
| Moderated | A Roblox admin changed the key secret for security. | Regenerate. |
| User Moderated | The generating account is under moderation. | Resolve the moderation. |

The 60-day auto-expiry is the most common surprise: keys you set up and forget will silently stop working. Either use them regularly or build a rotation/reminder process.

### Introspect endpoint

`POST https://apis.roblox.com/api-keys/v1/introspect` verifies whether a key is usable from the caller's IP and whether the key/user is moderated. Useful for debugging "why is my key failing":

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://apis.roblox.com/api-keys/v1/introspect' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"apiKey": "your-api-key"}'
```

Returns the key name, authorized user, scopes (with `userId`/`groupId`/`universeId`/`universeDatastore` resource identifiers — `*` means all resources of that type), `enabled`, `expired`, and `expirationTimeUtc`.

## The endpoint map

Base URL: `https://apis.roblox.com/cloud/v2/...` (plus a few `apis.roblox.com/<feature>/v1/...` legacy paths for assets). All v2 endpoints accept `x-api-key`.

### Data & memory stores (the most-used surface)

**Data stores** (`/cloud/v2/universes/{universe_id}/data-stores/...`):
- `ListDataStores`, `SnapshotDataStores` (daily snapshot trigger).
- `ListDataStoreEntries`, `CreateDataStoreEntry`, `GetDataStoreEntry`, `UpdateDataStoreEntry`, `IncrementDataStoreEntry`, `DeleteDataStoreEntry`.
- `ListDataStoreEntryRevisions` (version history per entry).
- Scoped variants under `/data-stores/{data_store_id}/scopes/{scope}/entries/...`.
- **Rate limits (v2):** share the experience Data Store request budgets with in-engine APIs (read/write/list/remove scale with concurrent users). See [error codes & limits](https://create.roblox.com/docs/cloud-services/data-stores/error-codes-and-limits#access-limits) and rate-limit external callers (fixed spacing or leaky bucket). Do not assume Open Cloud has a separate unlimited pool.
- **Legacy v1** (`/datastores/v1/`, `/ordered-data-stores/v1/`): after July 29, 2026 the fixed non-scaling tables on the [throttling guide](https://create.roblox.com/docs/cloud/guides/data-stores/throttling) apply only to those legacy paths.

**Memory stores** (`/cloud/v2/universes/{universe_id}/memory-stores/...`):
- Sorted maps: `ListMemoryStoreSortedMapItems`, `CreateMemoryStoreSortedMapItem`, `GetMemoryStoreSortedMapItem`, `UpdateMemoryStoreSortedMapItem`, `DeleteMemoryStoreSortedMapItem`.
- Queues: `CreateMemoryStoreQueueItem`, `ReadMemoryStoreQueueItems`, `DiscardMemoryStoreQueueItems`.
- `FlushMemoryStore` (requires `universe.memory-store:flush`).

**Ordered data stores** (`/cloud/v2/universes/{universe_id}/ordered-data-stores/...`):
- `ListOrderedDataStoreEntries`, `CreateOrderedDataStoreEntry`, `GetOrderedDataStoreEntry`, `UpdateOrderedDataStoreEntry`, `IncrementOrderedDataStoreEntry`, `DeleteOrderedDataStoreEntry`.
- Same shared experience budget model as standard Data Stores v2 (see error-codes page).

### Universes & places

- `GetUniverse`, `UpdateUniverse`.
- `PublishUniverseMessage` (publish a message to all servers of a universe — external counterpart to `MessagingService`).
- `RestartUniverseServers` (restart all live servers of a universe).
- `GetPlace`, `UpdatePlace` (publish a place version — the CI/CD primitive).
- `GetInstance`, `UpdateInstance`.

### Assets

- `GetAsset`, `ListAssetVersions`, `GetAssetVersion` (v1 path: `apis.roblox.com/assets/v1/assets/{assetId}`).
- Asset upload (images, audio, models) via the assets API — useful for batch-importing content.

### Users & inventories

- `GetUser`, `GenerateUserThumbnail`.
- `ListInventoryItems`.

### Groups

- `GetGroup`, `ListGroupMemberships`, `UpdateGroupMembership`, `ListGroupRoles`, `GetGroupRole`, `ListGroupJoinRequests`, `AcceptGroupJoinRequest`, `DeclineGroupJoinRequest`, `GetGroupShout`.

### Monetization (cross-ref roblox-gamepasses)

- Game passes: `CreateGamePass`, `UpdateGamePass`, `GetGamePassConfig`, `ListGamePassConfigsByUniverse`.
- Developer products: `CreateDeveloperProduct`, `UpdateDeveloperProduct`, `GetDeveloperProductConfig`, `ListDeveloperProductConfigsByUniverse`.
- Subscriptions: managed via subscription endpoints; webhook events for `cancelled`/`purchased`/`refunded`/`renewed`.

### Moderation & bans

- `ListUserRestrictions`, `GetUserRestriction`, `UpdateUserRestriction` (place- and universe-scoped), `ListUserRestrictionLogs`.

### Luau execution

- `CreateLuauExecutionSessionTask` (run Luau against a universe/place from outside the engine — powerful for automation, treat as privileged).

### Notifications & configs

- `CreateUserNotification` (send a notification to a user from outside the experience).
- Configs (CreatorConfigs): `GetConfigRepositoryValues`, draft/publish/revision flow for live configuration.

### Creator Store

- `CreateCreatorStoreProduct`, `GetCreatorStoreProduct`, `UpdateCreatorStoreProduct`, `CreatorStoreAssetsSearch`.

See https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/cloud for the full, current list (new endpoints are added regularly).

## Calling Open Cloud from in-experience (`HttpService`)

A subset of Open Cloud endpoints is callable from inside a live game server via `HttpService`. This is how you do things like update group memberships or kick users from external triggers without leaving the experience.

**Requirements:**
- Enable **Allow HTTP Requests** in Experience Settings.
- The API key must be stored as a `Secret` via the [Secrets Store](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/cloud-services/secrets) — retrieve it with `HttpService:GetSecret("APIKey")`. Never hardcode the key in a script.
- Only the `x-api-key` and `content-type` headers are allowed.
- The `x-api-key` value must be a `Secret` datatype, not a string.
- The `..` string is **not allowed** in URL path parameters (so data stores/entries containing `..` are inaccessible from `HttpService`).
- Only HTTPS; no ports below 1024 except 80/443; port 1194 blocked.

**Rate limits (per game server):**
- **2500 Open Cloud requests per minute** per server. Exceeding stalls request methods for ~30 seconds and `pcall` may fail with "Number of Open Cloud requests exceeded limit."
- Open Cloud requests **do not** count against the separate 500-req/min general HTTP limit.
- Each endpoint also has a per-key-owner limit enforced regardless of where calls originate.

Example — updating a group membership from in-experience:

```lua
--!strict
local HttpService = game:GetService("HttpService")

local function updateGroupMembership(groupId: string, membershipId: string, roleId: string)
    local response
    local ok, err = pcall(function()
        response = HttpService:RequestAsync({
            Url = `https://apis.roblox.com/cloud/v2/groups/{groupId}/memberships/{membershipId}`,
            Method = "PATCH",
            Headers = {
                ["Content-Type"] = "application/json",
                ["x-api-key"] = HttpService:GetSecret("APIKey"), -- Secret, not string
            },
            Body = HttpService:JSONEncode({ role = `groups/{groupId}/roles/{roleId}` }),
        })
    end)
    if not ok then
        warn("HTTP request failed:", err)
        return false
    end
    if response.Success then
        print("Updated:", response.StatusCode, response.StatusMessage)
        return true
    end
    warn("Error:", response.StatusCode, response.StatusMessage)
    return false
end
```

**Best practices:** pcall everything; retry safe reads by default, but retry mutations only with endpoint-specific idempotency semantics. On 429, honor `retry-after`, then `x-ratelimit-reset`, before bounded exponential backoff. Always retain the last response/error and do not sleep after the final attempt. Aggregate into bulk endpoints where possible; rely on HTTP/2 (automatic, but send lowercase header names). The Observability Dashboard (Creator Hub → Monitoring) shows request count and response time for your `HttpService` calls.

## Webhooks

Open Cloud emits webhooks for certain events, including **subscription** events (`cancelled`, `purchased`, `refunded`, `renewed`). Set up a webhook endpoint in your app, register it via the Cloud API, and Roblox will POST event payloads to it. This is the real-time path for subscription analytics without polling `GetUserSubscriptionPaymentHistoryAsync`. See https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/cloud/webhooks/webhook-notifications.

## Decision tree: in-engine vs Open Cloud

| Need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Normal player data read/write during a live server | In-engine `DataStoreService` |
| External bulk migration, cleanup, RTBF deletion | Open Cloud Data Stores |
| Scheduled daily snapshot before a risky publish | Open Cloud `SnapshotDataStores` |
| Restart all servers after a config change | Open Cloud `RestartUniverseServers` |
| Publish a place from CI | Open Cloud `UpdatePlace` |
| Upload many assets programmatically | Open Cloud Assets |
| Update a group role from in-experience | `HttpService` + Open Cloud `UpdateGroupMembership` |
| Send a notification to a user outside the experience | Open Cloud `CreateUserNotification` |
| Real-time subscription event analytics | Open Cloud webhooks |
| Normal monetization prompts/grants in-experience | In-engine `MarketplaceService` |
| Manage game pass/dev product config externally | Open Cloud game passes / developer products |

## Security checklist

- [ ] Keys stored in a secrets manager or Secrets Store, never in source/scripts.
- [ ] Minimum-permission scopes; experience-restricted where possible.
- [ ] IP restrictions for non-Roblox-server callers.
- [ ] Expiration dates on short-term keys; rotation process for long-term.
- [ ] Dedicated automation account for group resources (not your personal account).
- [ ] No `..` in data store keys you need to reach from `HttpService`.
- [ ] pcall every call; retry reads safely and require explicit idempotency before mutation retries.
- [ ] `x-api-key` passed as `Secret` from `HttpService`, not string.
- [ ] Audit key usage via the introspect endpoint and the Observability Dashboard.
- [ ] Disable/delete unused keys (they auto-expire after 60 days anyway, but don't rely on that as your only cleanup).
- [ ] Treat `CreateLuauExecutionSessionTask` as privileged — it runs Luau against your universe.

## Common mistakes this skill prevents

- Using legacy cookie-auth APIs for production (they break without notice).
- Storing API keys in scripts or source control.
- Using a personal account's key for group automation (compromises all your resources if the key leaks).
- Hitting the 2500-req/min `HttpService` Open Cloud limit by not batching.
- Running bulk Open Cloud v2 Data Store jobs without a client-side rate limiter (shared experience budget → live servers throttle).
- Expecting `..` in data store keys to work from `HttpService` (it doesn't).
- Forgetting the 60-day auto-expiry and having automation silently break.
- Using Open Cloud for things the in-engine API already does (unnecessary external dependency and latency).

## How to proceed

1. Identify whether the task is in-engine or external. If external, Open Cloud.
2. Create an API key with the minimum scopes for the task. If group-owned, use a dedicated account.
3. Store the key in a Secrets Store if calling from `HttpService`; otherwise in your secrets manager.
4. Test with the introspect endpoint and a single GET.
5. Build the workflow with pcall, header-aware rate limiting, and method/endpoint-aware retries. For bulk, prefer batch endpoints.
6. Set up webhooks for events you want in real time (subscriptions).
7. Monitor via the Observability Dashboard; rotate/replace keys before they auto-expire.
