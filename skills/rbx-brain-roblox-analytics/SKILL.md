# Roblox Analytics Reference

## When to Load

Load when tracking player behavior, economy events, or funnels; building custom event instrumentation; or understanding AnalyticsService rate limits and batching.

## Quick Reference

**Load Full Reference below only when you need specific API signatures or implementation patterns.**

Key rules:
- Use `AnalyticsService` (built-in). No third-party analytics SDK needed.
- Three event types: Custom (counters/values), Economy (currency flow), Funnel (step progression)
- Rate limit: 120 + (20 × CCU) calls per minute. Batch where possible.
- Max 100 custom events, 5 unique currency types, 10 funnels, 3 custom fields per event.
- Log events AFTER successful operations, not on attempt (avoids inflated metrics).
- Custom fields (up to 3) let you slice data without burning event cardinality.
- Economy events track sources (earned) and sinks (spent) separately.
- Funnel steps do not need to fire in order. If a later step is logged without earlier ones, the skipped intermediate steps are automatically back-filled as completed.
- Events appear on Creator Hub dashboard after ~24 hours. Use "View Events" for real-time validation.
- Server-side logging preferred for accuracy. Client-side only for UI interaction tracking.
- Creator Rewards has no AnalyticsService grant event. Use analytics for leading indicators such as session duration, onboarding, and referral-flow milestones; use Creator Dashboard for reward attribution and payout data.

**Economy health (decision layer):**
- Instrument from day one; you cannot backfill history when the economy breaks.
- For each currency log source AND sink with SKUs + balance-after-transaction.
- Health signals: sink/source ratio, inflation (dashboard formula: `CurrencySources - CurrencySinks`), whale concentration (docs: high ARPPU + low ARPDAU), price elasticity, sink sufficiency, D1/D7 cohorts. Thresholds are heuristics, not Roblox statements.
- When the economy breaks: verify events exist + correct, read narrowest broken signal, change ONE lever, re-check.
- Telemetry reports what broke; the user owns the design decision.

**Cross-refs:** `roblox-growth-design` for audit workflow; `roblox-monetization` for the purchase funnel.
