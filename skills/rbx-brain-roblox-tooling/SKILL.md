# roblox tooling

## When to Load

Load when setting up a filesystem workflow, pinning tools, adding packages, configuring lint or format checks, generating a sourcemap, or building CI for a Roblox project.

## Quick Reference

- Use Rojo when the source of truth should live in files and sync or build into Studio.
- Use Wally only when the project wants package manifests and a lockfile; keep package scope and server/client placement explicit.
- Pin tools with Aftman only when maintaining an existing Aftman project. Aftman is archived; for a new project, evaluate a maintained manager such as Rokit.
- Run Selene and StyLua in check mode in CI. Do not let a formatter rewrite a contributor's branch silently.
- Use Lune for standalone Luau scripts or test helpers when its standard libraries fit the task.
- Generate a Rojo sourcemap for editor tooling when the project needs Roblox-aware navigation.

**Source-of-truth first.** Know whether the place lives in Studio, in files (Rojo), or in a bidirectional sync before editing; never assume both sides match. Name optional tools (Selene, StyLua, luau-lsp, Lune, TestEZ, Wally) when relevant, but do not impose them on a project that does not use them. Details in `references/full.md` §§1b–1c.

**Need the details?** Load `references/full.md` for setup, file layout, and CI examples.
