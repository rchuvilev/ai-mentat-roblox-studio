# roblox tooling: full reference

> Code examples are illustrative. Adapt them to your project and verify in Studio before production use.

Tooling should make the source tree reproducible without forcing every project into the same framework. Keep the repository's chosen tools visible in its manifest and CI.

## 1. Decide what the project needs

| Need | Useful tool | Keep in mind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| file-to-Studio sync or build | Rojo | define the data-model mapping in a project file |
| third-party packages | Wally | commit the manifest and lockfile; choose realms intentionally |
| Luau linting | Selene | configure the Roblox standard and project exceptions |
| formatting | StyLua | pin the formatter and run a check in CI |
| standalone scripts | Lune | use only where its runtime libraries are appropriate |
| tool versions | Aftman or an existing manager | one source of truth for versions |
| editor navigation | luau-lsp plus a sourcemap | regenerate the map when the tree changes |

If the project already has a working toolchain, extend it before introducing another manager.

## 1b. Source-of-truth paradigm

Before any file tooling matters, know which side owns the place: Studio or files. This determines what an agent may safely touch and what the failure modes look like.

| Paradigm | Source of truth | Typical setup | Failure mode to guard |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Studio-first | The open `.rbxl` in Studio | Edit directly in Studio; scripts live in the place | No file layer for git, diffing, or CI; agent edits are invisible outside Studio and can be lost |
| Files-first | A repo on disk | Rojo project; `rojo serve` syncs files to Studio | Rojo can overwrite unbuilt Studio edits after a reload; `.rbxl` binary diffs are useless |
| Bidirectional sync | Both, with conflict rules | WEPPY-style or similar plugin that mirrors Studio tree to files both ways | Two sources of truth need explicit conflict resolution (Studio priority, local priority, per-file) or changes silently overwrite each other |

When working with an agentic tool:

- **Detect the paradigm first.** Ask or check: is this a Rojo project (files-first)? Is the place only open in Studio (Studio-first)? Is there a sync plugin with a local mirror (bidirectional)?
- **Never assume both sides are in sync.** Before mutating, read from the source of truth, then write to the same side. After an agent changes files, verify Studio reflects it (and vice versa), especially after a reload.
- **Rojo gotchas:** `rojo serve` watches the filesystem; a script written into Studio by another tool can be overwritten on the next sync, and an agent editing files must run `rojo build` or rely on serve to push. Do not mix MCP-driven Studio edits with a running Rojo serve on the same place without acknowledging which side wins.
- **Bidirectional sync gotchas:** conflict resolution is a real decision, not a default. If both sides changed, pick Studio priority or local priority per file and say which; do not apply both silently.

## 1c. Optional ecosystem: name it, do not push

Some tooling improves agent and developer productivity but is not essential to a working Roblox project. An agent should **mention these exist** when a user asks about them or is clearly doing work they would automate (linting, formatting, test orchestration), but **should not impose them** on a project that does not use them:

- **Selene** (lint), **StyLua** (format), **luau-lsp** (editor intelligence), **Lune** (standalone Luau scripts/tests), **TestEZ** (test runner), **Wally** (packages), **Aftman/Rokit** (tool manager), **Rojo** (files-first sync).

The line: if the user asks "should I add linting/formatting/tests?" or is hand-doing something these automate, offer the option and the tradeoff, then let them choose. If the project already has a toolchain, extend it; do not introduce a new ecosystem unprompted. The exceptions that justify recommendation: files-first source control (Rojo) and CI reproducibility, when the user is clearly trying to version or automate their project.

## 2. Rojo project mapping

A Rojo project file maps filesystem paths to Roblox services. Keep the mapping small and obvious.

```json
{
  "name": "ExampleGame",
  "tree": {
    "$className": "DataModel",
    "ReplicatedStorage": {
      "$path": "src/ReplicatedStorage"
    },
    "ServerScriptService": {
      "$path": "src/ServerScriptService"
    },
    "StarterPlayer": {
      "StarterPlayerScripts": {
        "$path": "src/StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

File suffixes communicate the Roblox instance type in the usual Rojo workflow:

- `.server.luau` maps to a server `Script`;
- `.client.luau` maps to a client `LocalScript`;
- `.luau` maps to a `ModuleScript`;
- `init.luau` can represent a module at a folder boundary.

Use the exact conventions documented by the project's Rojo version. Test both `rojo serve` for development and `rojo build` for a reproducible artifact.

## 3. Packages with Wally

A package manifest should state whether a dependency is shared, server-only, client-only, or development-only. Keep the lockfile under version control so CI resolves the same graph.

```toml
[package]
name = "team/example-game"
version = "0.1.0"
registry = "https://github.com/UpliftGames/wally-index"
realm = "shared"

[dependencies]
Promise = "evaera/promise@4.0.0"

[dev-dependencies]
TestEZ = "roblox/testez@0.4.2"
```

The names and versions above are examples, not recommendations. Verify package ownership, license, compatibility, and the project's existing conventions before adding a dependency. Do not copy a package into the repository just to avoid documenting it.

## 4. Pin the toolchain

Aftman is archived and should be treated as legacy compatibility. If an existing repository already uses `aftman.toml`, keep its versions pinned and avoid an unrelated migration during feature work. For a new project, evaluate a maintained manager such as Rokit or another toolchain that the team can support.

An existing Aftman manifest can look like this:
```toml
[tools]
rojo = "rojo-rbx/rojo@7.7.0"
wally = "UpliftGames/wally@0.3.2"
selene = "kampfkarren/selene@0.31.0"
stylua = "JohnnyMorganz/StyLua@2.5.2"
lune = "lune-org/lune@0.10.5"
```

Use versions tested by the repository. Update them deliberately, review generated lockfile changes, and record compatibility failures rather than silently floating to the newest release.

## 5. Selene

Configure the Roblox standard and keep suppressions narrow.

```toml
std = "roblox"

[rules]
unused_variable = "warn"
shadowing = "warn"

[config]
allow_defined_top = true
```

Run `selene src` locally and in CI. Prefer a named configuration or a small inline suppression with a reason over disabling a rule for the whole project.

## 6. StyLua

Formatting is a repository convention. Keep the configuration short and run the formatter in check mode in automation.

```toml
column_width = 100
indent_type = "Spaces"
indent_width = 4
quote_style = "AutoPreferDouble"
call_parentheses = "Always"
```

Use `stylua --check .` in CI and `stylua .` only as an explicit developer action. Do not mix formatter changes with a gameplay change unless the repository expects format-on-save commits.

## 7. Lune and standalone scripts

Lune is useful for file transforms, test orchestration, and small repository utilities. Keep Roblox-only code out of scripts that must run without Studio.

```luau
local fs = require("@lune/fs")
local serde = require("@lune/serde")

local manifest = serde.decode("json", fs.readFile("manifest.json"))
print(manifest.name)
```

A Lune script is not automatically a Roblox runtime script. Document which APIs it expects and make its inputs and outputs testable from CI.

## 8. Sourcemaps and editor support

If the editor needs Roblox-aware type information, generate a sourcemap from the same Rojo project file used for development. Treat the generated map as disposable build output unless the repository explicitly versions it.

Regenerate it after adding services, moving modules, or changing suffixes. A stale map can make correct code look broken and can hide incorrect paths.

## 9. CI sequence

A small pipeline can use this order:

1. install the pinned tools;
2. restore or install Wally dependencies;
3. run Selene;
4. run StyLua in check mode;
5. generate a sourcemap if luau-lsp analysis is enabled;
6. run standalone Lune tests or project tests;
7. run `rojo build` and inspect the artifact boundary.

Keep credentials out of project files and CI logs. If a build needs a Roblox API credential, inject it through the CI secret store and use the narrowest scope available.

## 10. Ignore generated output

The exact list depends on the project, but commonly generated paths include:

```gitignore
/Packages/
/.aftman/
/build/
sourcemap.json
*.rbxl
```

Do not ignore source, lockfiles, configuration, or test fixtures by accident. Check `git status` after installing tools and packages.

## 11. Documentation indexes for agents

Roblox publishes LLM-oriented documentation indexes that route an agent to the correct API surface before it starts reading:

- `https://create.roblox.com/docs/llms.txt`: top-level index; use it first.
- `https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/llms.txt`: Engine API index (Luau inside an experience).
- `https://create.roblox.com/docs/cloud/llms.txt`: Open Cloud API index (REST from external servers).
- `https://create.roblox.com/docs/llms-full.txt`: all docs in one file (large).
- `https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/deprecated.md`: deprecated API inventory.

The Engine API and Open Cloud API are separate systems. Engine APIs are Luau objects via `game:GetService()` inside a running experience; Open Cloud APIs are HTTP endpoints called with an `x-api-key` from outside Roblox. Fetching the wrong index produces non-functional code, so route first.

## Tooling checklist

- [ ] The project has one documented source-to-Studio workflow.
- [ ] Tool versions are pinned and tested.
- [ ] Dependencies have explicit realms and licenses.
- [ ] Lint and format checks run without rewriting files in CI.
- [ ] Sourcemaps and build artifacts have a clear ownership policy.
- [ ] Standalone scripts declare their runtime assumptions.
- [ ] CI produces a reproducible build or reports why it cannot.
